Fitzgerald, Molloy College, NY</p><h2>Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer</h2><p>To all appearances, Dennis Rader was a model citizen in the small town of Park City, Kansas, where he had lived with his family almost his entire life. He was a town compliance officer, a former Boy Scout leader, the president of his church congregation, and a seemingly ordinary father and husband. But Rader&#39;s average life belied the existence of his dark, sadistic other self: he was the BTK serial killer.The self-named BTK (for Bind, Torture, Kill) had terrorized Wichita for thirty-one years, not only with his brutal, sexually motivated crimes, but also through his taunting, elusive communications with the media and law enforcement. In 1974, BTK committed his first murders -- torturing and strangling four members of the Otero family -- and wrote the police an audacious letter declaring his responsibility for the Oteros&#39; deaths and labeling himself, for the first time, BTK. Thus he established a pattern -- stalking and killing a series of ten victims, then bragging and claiming ownership of his crimes -- that ended in 1991 but left law enforcement confounded and the public with deeply troubling memories. Until, that is, he resurfaced in 2004 with another string of letters that would finally lead to his arrest. Drawing from extensive interviews with Rader&#39;s pastor, congregation, detectives, and psychologists who worked the case, and from his unnervingly de-tailed thirty-two-hour confession, bestselling author Stephen Singular delves into the disturbing life and crimes of BTK to explore fully -- for the first time -- the most dangerous and complex serial killer of our generation and the man who embodied, at once, astonishing extremes of normality and abnormality. In Unholy Messenger, Singular recounts the year prior to Rader&#39;s arrest, in which the BTK killer reemerged, and the aftermath. Woven throughout are the details of his crimes, elaborate schemes, and bids for public attention, and the wrenching impact his deception had on his family, church, and heartland community. attention, and the wrenching impact his deception had on his family, church, and heartland community. The result is a chilling story of a man considered a &#34;spiritual leader&#34; by his pastor and congregation, who turned out to be the devil next door. More than just true crime, Unholy Messenger is a powerful, thoroughly engrossing examination of the intersection between good and evil, and of the psychology and spirituality of a killer in whom faith and bloodshed converged.</p><p><b>Stephen Singular</b> has authored or coauthored seventeen previous books, including numerous <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Los Angeles Times</i> bestsellers. His titles include <i>Presumed Guilty: An Investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey Case, the Media, and the Culture of Pornography</i>; and <i>Anyone You Want Me to Be: A True Story of Sex and Death on the Internet</i>, coauthored with legendary FBI profiler John Douglas.

Rader, a Scout leader, faithful churchgoer, husband, and father was also BTK, the sadistic killer who terrorized Wichita, Kansas, for thirty years. Drawing from over 300 pages of Rader's testimony, as well as interviews with co-workers, neighbors, and the pastor of the Rader's congregation, journalist Stephen Singular objectively presents the many faces of the monster-next-door. Alan Sklar's narration makes this macabre true-crime a standout. His storytelling is dignified. His gentle, comforting tones make hearing even the most lurid details almost bearable. Sklar's understated, intelligent presentation makes for compelling listening.

How did the process for <i>The Drop</i>, the book and the film&#x2014;evolve? </p> <p><strong>Dennis</strong>: 10+ years ago, I attempted a novel in which one of the characters rescued a dog from a trash can. I couldn&#x2019;t pull the novel together, though. It broke my heart because I loved several of the characters&#x2014;the guy who found the dog, his cousin who owned a bar, a woman he met, a messed up but well-meaning cop. A few years later, I went back to the first chapter, where Bob Saginowski finds the dog, and turned it into a short story. Some folks in Hollywood asked if I&#x2019;d adapt it into a screenplay. The idea appealed to me because I still had that bench of secondary characters I hadn&#x2019;t gotten a chance to use. </p> <p><strong>David</strong>: <i>The Drop</i> is your screenwriting debut. How does writing a screenplay differ from writing prose? Which do you prefer? </p> <p><strong>Dennis</strong>: A novelist is God; all originates from him and he has final say over his universe from a single blade of grass to breadth of the Milky Way. A screenwriter is an employee, one of maybe 150 people who contribute to a film. It&#x2019;s so much less stressful being the employee than it is being God, no question, but maybe I like stress. </p> <p><strong>David</strong>: What was it like to revisit characters you initially created for a short story and bring them into a full length novel? </p> <p><strong>Dennis</strong>: It was like bringing them home. They&#x2019;d belonged in a novel all along; it just took me over a decade to figure out what that novel/script/film actually was. </p> <p><strong>David</strong>: What&#x2019;s it like to see characters you&#x2019;ve created in print come to life on screen? Do you find that actors surprise you, draw out qualities that you didn&#x2019;t recognize on the page? </p> <p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Great actors have no skin. They&#x2019;re all exposed nerve and naked heart. To watch someone as gifted as Tom Hardy, Sean Penn, or Amy Ryan, to name just three, inhabit my characters and take them to places I never could have predicted&#x2014;but to do so with conviction and honesty&#x2014;has been profoundly gratifying. </p> <p><strong>David</strong>: The dog plays such a central role in this story. Where did your inspiration for him come from? </p> <p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I love dogs. Got one snoring at my feet as I write this. </p> <p><strong>David</strong>: The setting of Boston has always played an important role in your novels. What brings you back there? </p> <p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I was blessed to grow up in a unique city during difficult times. It&#x2019;s given me a lifelong affinity for unique and difficult things. </p> <p><strong>David</strong>: <i>The Drop</i> is a gritty, dark story, and there are no conventional &#x201c;heroes.&#x201d; Do you ever have an author&#x2019;s anxiety about characters&#x2019; likeability? Dennis: No. We loved Tony Soprano, a murderer who destroyed most of what he touched, because he was harried by his mother and couldn&#x2019;t get his basic household appliances to work when he needed them to; we loved Othello, even after he murdered his wife, because most of us understand the pain of being treated as second class, regardless of our achievement. Audiences don&#x2019;t what likeable characters, they want relatable ones. In <i>The Drop</i> what the characters want&#x2014;absolution from past sins; respect; a knight to come to their rescue; confirmation of their faith&#x2014;strikes me as pretty common stuff. Not dark at all.

He&#x2019;s authored thirty-six novels and two short story collections.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.<br> <br>FOR THE REST of the world, the season was still fall, marked by cool nights and the gold-green remnants of summer. For me, down in South Louisiana, in the Garden District of New Orleans, the wetlands that lay far beyond my hospital window had turned to winter, one characterized by stricken woods that were drained of water and strung with a web of gray leaves and dead air vines that had wrapped themselves as tightly as cord around the trees.<br> <br>Those who have had the following experience will not find my descriptions exaggerated or even metaphorical in nature. A morphine dream has neither walls nor a ceiling nor a floor. The sleep it provides is like a warm bath, free of concerns about mortality and pain and memories from the past. Morpheus also allows us vision through a third eye that we never knew existed. His acolytes can see through time and become participants in grand events they had believed accessible only through history books and films. On one occasion, I saw a hot-air balloon rising from its tether in Audubon Park, a uniformed soldier operating a telegrapher&#x2019;s key inside the wicker basket, while down below other members of the Confederate Signal Corps shared sandwiches and drank coffee from tin cups, all of them as stately and stiff as figures in a sepia-tinted photograph.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t wish to be too romantic about my experience in the recovery facility there on St. Charles Avenue in uptown New Orleans. While I gazed through my window at the wonderful green streetcar wobbling down the tracks on the neutral ground, the river fog puffing out of the live oak trees, the pink and purple neon on the Katz &amp; Besthoff drugstore as effervescent as tentacles of smoke twirling from marker grenades, I knew with a sinking heart that what I was seeing was an illusion, that in reality the Katz &amp; Besthoff drugstore and the umbrella-covered sno&#x2019;ball carts along St. Charles and the musical gaiety of the city had slipped into history long ago, and somewhere out on the edge of my vision, the onset of permanent winter waited for me.<br> <br>Though I&#x2019;m a believer, that did not lessen the sense of trepidation I experienced in these moments. I felt as if the sun were burning a hole in the sky, causing it to blacken and collapse like a giant sheet of carbon paper suddenly crinkling and folding in on itself, and I had no power to reverse the process. I felt that a great darkness was spreading across the land, not unlike ink spilling across the face of a topographic map.<br> <br>Many years ago, when I was recovering from wounds I received in a Southeast Asian country, a United States Army psychiatrist told me that my morphine-induced dreams were creating what he called a &#x201c;world destruction fantasy,&#x201d; one that had its origins in childhood and the dissolution of one&#x2019;s natal family. He was a scientist and a learned man, and I did not argue with him. Even at night, when I lay in a berth on a hospital ship, far from free-fire zones and the sound of ammunition belts popping under a burning hooch, I did not argue. Nor did I contend with the knowledge of the psychiatrist when dead members of my platoon spoke to me in the rain and a mermaid with an Asian face beckoned to me from a coral cave strung with pink fans, her hips spangled with yellow coins, her mouth parting, her naked breasts as flushed with color as the inside of a conch shell.<br> <br>The cult of Morpheus is a strange community indeed, and it requires that one take up residence in a country where the improbable becomes commonplace. No matter what I did, nor how many times I disappeared out my window into the mists along St. Charles Avenue, back into an era of rooftop jazz bands and historical streetcars filled with men in bowler hats and women who carried parasols, the watery gray rim of a blighted planet was always out there&#x2014;intransigent and corrupt, a place where moth and rust destroy and thieves break in and steal.<br> <br>IN THE EARLY A.M. on a Friday, I asked the black attendant to open the windows in my room. It was against the rules, but the attendant was an elderly and kind man who had spent five days on a rooftop after the collapse of the levees during Hurricane Katrina, and he wasn&#x2019;t given to concerns about authority. The windows reached to the ceiling and were hung with ventilated green shutters that were closed during the heat of the day to filter the sun&#x2019;s glare. The attendant opened both the glass and the shutters and let in the night smell of the roses and camellias and magnolia and rain mist blowing through the trees. The air smelled like Bayou Teche when it&#x2019;s spring and the fish are spawning among the water hyacinths and the frogs are throbbing in the cattails and the flooded cypress. It smelled like the earth may have smelled during the first days of creation, before any five-toed footprints appeared along the banks of a river.<br> <br>Or at least I think the black man opened the windows. Even to this day I cannot be sure of what I said and saw and heard that night. Like the drunkard who fears both his memory and his dreams, I had become cynical about my perceptions, less out of fear that they were illusions than a conviction that they were real.<br> <br>After the black man had left the room, I turned my head on the pillow and looked into the face of a Cajun girl by the name of Tee Jolie Melton.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mr. Dave,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I read all about the shooting in the papers. You was on television, too. I didn&#x2019;t know you was here in New Orleans. I&#x2019;m sorry to see you hurt like this. You was talking French in your sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to see you, Tee Jolie. How&#x2019;d you get in?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;T&#x2019;rew the front door. You want me to come back another time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you get me a glass of water?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got you better than that. I brought you a Dr Pepper and a lime I cut up, &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s what you always drank when you came into the club. I brought you somet&#x2019;ing else, too. It&#x2019;s an iPod I filled wit&#x2019; music. I loaded &#x2018;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&#x2019; on it, &#x2019;cause I knew how you always liked that song.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes were blue-green, her hair long and mahogany-colored with twists of gold in it that were as bright as buttercups. She was part Indian and part Cajun and part black and belonged to that ethnic group we call Creoles, although the term is a misnomer.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember when you he&#x2019;ped me with my car crash? You was so kind. You took care of everyt&#x2019;ing, and I didn&#x2019;t have no trouble at all because of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t <i>a</i> car crash. As I recalled, <i>it</i> was at least three car crashes, but I didn&#x2019;t pursue the point. The most interesting aspect of Tee Jolie&#x2019;s auto accidents were her written explanations at the scene. To the best of my memory, these were her words:<br> <br>&#x201c;I was backing up when this light pole came out of nowhere and smashed into my bumper.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was turning left, but somebody was blocking the lane, so, trying to be polite, I switched my turn indicator and cut through the school parking lot, but I didn&#x2019;t have no way of knowing the chain was up on the drive at that time of day, because it never is.<br> <br>&#x201c;When the transmission went into reverse, Mr. Fontenot was putting my groceries in the backseat, and the door handle caught his coat sleeve and drug him across the street into the gas pump that blew up. I tried to give him first aid on the mouth, but he had already swallowed this big wad of gum that the fireman had to pull out with his fingers. I think Mr. Fontenot almost bit off one of the fireman&#x2019;s fingers and didn&#x2019;t have the courtesy to say he was sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tee Jolie fixed a glass of ice and Dr Pepper with a lime slice and stuck a straw in it and held it up to my mouth. She was wearing a long-sleeve shirt printed with purple and green flowers. Her skirt was pale blue and fluffy and pleated, and her shoes looked tiny on her feet. You could say that Tee Jolie was made for the camera, her natural loveliness of a kind that begged to be worshipped on a stage or hung on a wall. Her face was thin, her eyes elongated, and her hair full of waves, as though it had been recently unbraided, although that was the way it always looked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel selfish coming here, &#x2019;cause it wasn&#x2019;t just to give you a Dr Pepper and the iPod,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I came here to ax you somet&#x2019;ing, but I ain&#x2019;t gonna do it now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can say anything you want, Tee Jolie, because I&#x2019;m not even sure you&#x2019;re here. I dream in both the day and the night about people who have been dead many years. In my dreams, they&#x2019;re alive, right outside the window, Confederate soldiers and the like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They had to come a long way, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s safe to say,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;My wife and daughter were here earlier, and I know they were real. I&#x2019;m not sure about you. No offense meant. That&#x2019;s just the way it is these days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know something I ain&#x2019;t suppose to know, and it makes me scared, Mr. Dave,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>She was sitting in the chair, her ankles close together, her hands folded on her knees. I had always thought of her as a tall girl, particularly when she was onstage at the zydeco club where she sang, an arterial-red electric guitar hanging from her neck. Now she looked smaller than she had a few moments ago. She lifted her face up into mine. There was a mole by the corner of her mouth. I didn&#x2019;t know what she wanted me to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you get involved with some bad guys?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t call them that. How come you to ax me that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re a good person, and sometimes you trust people you shouldn&#x2019;t. Good women tend to do that. That&#x2019;s why a lot of us men don&#x2019;t deserve them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father was killed in a oil-well blowout, wasn&#x2019;t he? Out on the Gulf when you was in Vietnam. That&#x2019;s right, ain&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, he was a derrick man.&#x201d;<br> <br>As with many Creoles and Cajuns, there was a peculiarity at work in Tee Jolie&#x2019;s speech. She was ungrammatical and her vocabulary was limited, but because of the cadence in her language and her regional accent, she was always pleasant to listen to, a voice from a gentler and more reserved time, even when what she spoke of was not pleasant to think about, in this case the death of my father, Big Aldous.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m wit&#x2019; a man. He&#x2019;s separated but not divorced. A lot of people know his name. Famous people come to the place where we live. I heard them talking about centralizers. You know what they are?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re used inside the casing on drilling wells.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bunch of men was killed &#x2019;cause maybe not enough of those centralizers was there or somet&#x2019;ing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read about that, Tee Jolie. It&#x2019;s public knowledge. You shouldn&#x2019;t worry because you know about this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The man I&#x2019;m wit&#x2019; does bidness sometimes with dangerous people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you should get away from him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna be married. I&#x2019;m gonna have his baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>I fixed my gaze on the glass of Dr Pepper and ice that sat on the nightstand.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want some more?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but I can hold it by myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Except I see the pain in your face when you move,&#x201d; she said. She lifted the glass and straw to my mouth. &#x201c;They hurt you real bad, huh, Mr. Dave?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They shot me up proper,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;They shot your friend Mr. Clete, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They smacked both of us around. But we left every one of them on the ground. They&#x2019;re going to be dead for a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Outside the window, I could hear the rain and wind sweeping through the trees, scattering leaves from the oaks and needles from the slash pines across the roof.<br> <br>&#x201c;I always had my music and the piece of land my father left me and my sister and my mama,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I sang wit&#x2019; BonSoir, Catin. I was queen of the Crawfish Festival in Breaux Bridge. I t&#x2019;ink back on that, and it&#x2019;s like it was ten years ago instead of two. A lot can change in a short time, cain&#x2019;t it? My mama died. Now it&#x2019;s just me and my li&#x2019;l sister, Blue, and my granddaddy back in St. Martinville.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a great musician, and you have a wonderful voice. You&#x2019;re a beautiful person, Tee Jolie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you talk like that, it don&#x2019;t make me feel good, no. It makes me sad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He says I can have an abortion if I want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s his offer to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t got his divorce yet. He ain&#x2019;t a bad man. You know him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me his name,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come?&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Because I might want to put a bullet between his eyes</i>, I thought. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my business,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Did you really give me this iPod?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You just saw me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t trust what I see and hear these days. I truly want to believe you&#x2019;re real. The iPod is too expensive a gift.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for me. He gives me plenty of money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My wallet is in the nightstand drawer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got to go, Mr. Dave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take the money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I hope you like the songs. I put t&#x2019;ree of mine in there. I put one in there by Taj Mahal &#x2019;cause I know you like him, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you really here?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>She cupped her hand on my brow. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re burning up, you,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Then she was gone.<br> <br>NINE DAYS LATER, a big man wearing a seersucker suit and a bow tie and spit-shined shoes and a fresh haircut and carrying a canvas bag on a shoulder strap came into the room and pulled up a chair by the bed and stuck an unlit cigarette in his mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to smoke that in here, are you?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t bother to answer. His blond hair was cut like a little boy&#x2019;s. His eyes were bright green, more energetic than they should have been, one step below wired.

Born a princess in the region of Rajasthan in 1498, Mira (as she is more commonly known) fought tradition and celebrated a woman's right to an independent life in her ecstatic poems. Her royal family arranged an early marriage for her, but she felt a marriage to Krishna was more important. As a result, her life became a model of social defiance and spiritual integrity. <br><br>During her lifetime, Mira's reputation spread across her country. She was known as a woman of immense talent and devotion. By the time she died in 1550, she was considered a saint. People across India recited and danced to her poems, and they still do today. In this collection, Robert Bly and Jane Hirshfield, two of America's best poets, have created lively English versions of Mirabai's poems, using fresh images and energetic rhythms to make them accessible to modern readers. Their work makes clear that Mirabai's poetry transcends her time and culture.<br><br>Columbia University professor of religion John Stratton Hawley provides an afterword to the volume that discusses what is known of Mirabai's life and reputation. With a historian's precision, he shows how Bly and Hirshfield's versions belong to a tradition of reinterpretation and rephrasing that is already centuries old.<br><br>Mirabai comes to life through the impressive interpreting of her poems by Bly and Hirshfield. The poems feel as fresh today as they must have felt when this amazing woman sung them herself five centuries ago.</p><p>Robert Bly is the author of The Night Abraham Called to the Stars, a book of poems in the ghazal form, as well as ten other collections of poetry. He has published several books of prose, including <i>Iron John</i> and <i>The Sibling Society.</i> Recently published, <i>The Winged Energy of Delight</i> is a gathering of poems by twenty-two poets from various languages that Bly has translated over the last forty years. Bly lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.We are so fortunate that two magnificent poets have been drawn to Mirabai's music. Like two twining flutes, Robert Bly and Jane Hirshfield ignite these subtle, surrendered-heart notes, as 'a steeped herb' releasing its cure, and even though we ourselves may be bogged down in our 'patch of gooseberry bushes' (both their images), still we catch. -Coleman Barks, author of <i>The Drowned Book</i> and <i>The Essential Rumi</i></p><h2>Sunlight At Midnight St. Petersburg And The Rise Of Modern Russia</h2><p>For Russians, St. Petersburg has embodied power, heroism, and fortitude. It has encompassed all the things that the Russians are and that they hope to become. Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln&#39;s lavish &#34;biography&#34; of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a &#34;paradise.&#34; His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia&#39;s far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents. In this book, revolutionaries and laborers brush shoulders with tsars, and builders, soldiers, and statesmen share pride of place with poets. For only the entire historical experience of this magnificent and mysterious city can reveal the wealth of human and natural forces that shaped the modern history of it and the nation it represents.</p><p>W. Bruce Lincoln was Distinguished Professor of Russian History at Northern Illinois University. He was the author of Between Heaven and Hell: The Story of a Thousand Years of Artistic Life in Russia and almost a dozen other books. W. Bruce Lincoln died on April 9, 2000, at the age of sixty-one.Published posthumously, this history is based on the old adage that St. Petersburg is Russia's "window to the West," that it represents a "psychological force, an intellectual vision, and a way of life against which everything else in Russia has been measured." Lincoln (Conquest of a Continent, one of PW's Best Books for 1994), a top Russian scholar and professor at Northern Illinois University for 31 years, offers a highly accessible and gripping account. ("Dancing was her favorite pastime, and fashion one of her chief concerns," Lincoln writes of Catherine the Great. "Pages at her court strutted in bottle-green uniforms trimmed with gold lace and faced in red as they served guests in the European fashion.") Lincoln focuses on major events like the city's construction, the October Revolution and the Great Blockade; Russian history buffs will find little new here. However, Lincoln's meticulous, colorful detail enlivens these well-trod stories. The work would have benefited from more current material Lincoln barely grazes post-WWII St. Petersburg and the city's window-to-the-West status rings more romantic than true today. Lincoln's homage to St. Petersburg doesn't address the city's present or future. He concludes with a platitude: "the people of St. Petersburg have always striven to reach beyond the limits of normal human experience. No doubt they will do so again, but only time can reveal what form their efforts will take." It's unfortunate that this fine, passionate work, too, didn't strive a bit more. 75 photos. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Year 1000 : An Englishman&#39;s Year</h2><p>In the year 1000 the world was one of mystery and magicians, monks, warriors and wandering merchants - people who feared an apocalypse and people who had no idea what year it was or what lay beyond the nearest valley.

Smiths and ploughmen; spirits of forest, stream, and home; the upper and lower worlds and the cult of death; serpents, dragons, and monsters; witches and wizards; shape-changing; wondrous animals; and giants and midgets are among the subjects covered. Familiar figures like Baba Yaga and Vasilisa receive their due. The appendix includes sections on symbolism and the Russian alphabet. Koshkin's exquisite paintings and his intelligent, witty line drawings make this a memorable book. Unfortunately, the arrangement of text on the page makes for a monotonous, uninviting appearance. Double vertical columns with scant margins detract from a thing of beauty.

Folklorist Warner draws on original Russian sources, retelling the stories with direct drama and weaving them together with general discussion about their folklore motifs and history. The famous witch Baba Yaga is here, so is the evil Koshchei the Deathless; and there are chapters on giants and midgets, serpents and dragons, smiths and ploughmen. There are nature myths and Russian wonder tales of worlds above and worlds below. The individual stories are great for sharing, and the collection is an excellent resource for cross-curricular studies of Russian history and culture.

Through a career that spanned decades and 140 films -- among them such American masterpieces as The Searchers, The Grapes of Wrath, Stagecoach, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance -- John Ford left a cinematic legacy that few filmmakers will ever equal. Yet Ford himself was famously reticent about his personal life, often fabricating details and events. In this definitive look at the life and career of one of America's greatest directors, Scott Eyman offers a remarkable portrait of the man behind the legend that reveals how a saloon keeper's son from Maine helped to shape Hollywood's idea of America.</p></p><p>Borrowing his title from dialogue in John Ford's classic Western, <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> ("When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"), Scott Eyman heeds this advice in his splendid study of Ford, finding a convincing balance between the gruff image Ford cultivated and the sensitive artist that Ford truly was. The result is a to-date definitive biography, occasionally prone to indelicate critical assessment while benefiting greatly from Eyman's full access to the Ford family archives. Arguably the greatest American filmmaker of the 20th century, Ford protected himself with a fa�ade of belligerence yet engendered more loyalty among his crew and stock players (notably John Wayne and Ward Bond) than any other director. Eyman illuminates the Ford legend while focusing on fact--on a complex genius who would berate even the most vulnerable actor and then "apologize without apologizing," a binge drinker who never let alcohol interfere with his closely-guarded artistry, and a stalwart Navy captain whose service in World War II became his primary source of pride.<p> <i>Print the Legend</i> essentially confirms Ford's brief affair with Katharine Hepburn, but Eyman emphasizes Ford's deep, abiding affection for his wife, Mary, who valiantly tolerated his absolute devotion to filmmaking. While hundreds of interviews yield a comprehensive account of Ford's working methods (which the director was loathe to discuss), Eyman expertly navigates around Ford's own penchant for autobiographical embellishment. What emerges is likely to remain the most thorough portrait of a cinematic master who recognized his own greatness without parading it, and whose human flaws were ultimately forgivable by those--and they were many--who loved him. Readers should look elsewhere for more astute studies of Ford's films, but Eyman has captured Ford the man with lasting authority. <i>-- Jeff Shannon</i></p><p>Scott Eyman is the books editor for the Palm Beach Post.

Frederick Baroh, descended from a once-aristoerotic family, serves in a rifle regiment of the People's Army garrisoned in his old hometown in Silesia before deserting to the West. (Jilnger, not incidentally, fought in both world wars, and as a captain took part in the occupation of France; in 1939, however, he had written a widely read anti-Nazi novel.) Once in the West, Baroh joins his uncle's funeral business and then develops an enormously lucrative enterprise-a vast, world-famous necropoIis.

Written in a refreshingly open, simple and accessible first person style, the author's passion, dedication and vast clinical experience is abundantly clear.Whole-Body Dentistry is logically and compellingly organized starting with a personal account of Dr. Breiner's journey from an advocate of the "party line" offered by conventional dentistry to an advocate of wellness through data-based (not politically correct) choices. Believing that "if you wish to understand the body and healing, you must be willing to explore and learn from new ideas and from your patient's responses", this book serves another function as well. It documents the admirable course which every healing professional should take from predigested teaching to courageous exploration which follows wherever the data leads. <p>Our culture is currently in the midst of a great paradigm evolution. Scientism (rigidly adhering to dogma) battles science (which dares question all previous truths fearlessly). This is beautifully exemplified by the tension between "conventional" and "alternative" medicines. Practitioners like Dr. Breiner, by following their patient's clinical realities in integrity, despite personal cost, light the path to the new options for excellence. </p><p>But Whole-Body Dentistry does more: by offering simple, clear and concise information it informs and opens possibilities for patients who wish to become active and knowledgeable participants in their health care.

Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet's signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment. Through the exploits of his characters, Peet offered his audience a chance to see themselves and their world through new eyes.<br><br>"At some point," Bill Peet once said, "it occurred to me that drawing was something I couldn't possibly give up, and somehow it must be turned into a <br>profession." He went on to not only fulfill his dream but to introduce generations of young readers to his delightful vision of humor, friendship and<br>compassion.</p><h2>The Wonder of Boys</h2><p>The author describes in an insightful and practical way what boys need to become strong, responsible, sensitive men. Instead of encouraging us to stifle boys&#39; natural propensities for competition and aggression, the author offers effective and practical guidelines for channeling them.</p><p>In the thoughtful and provocative <i>The Wonder of Boys: What Parents, Mentors, and Educators Can Do to Shape Boys into Exceptional Men</i>, therapist and educator Michael Gurian takes a close look at modern boyhood. Gurian asserts that the biological and neurological differences between boys and girls need to be accounted for and nourished in order to raise healthy, happy boys. In discussing boy culture--and the roles of competition, aggression, and physical risk taking--the author concludes, "It's not boy culture that's inherently flawed; it's the way we manage it." If the natural, testosterone-based impulses of boys are squelched or ignored, Gurian posits, such biological truths may find their way to the surface in other, more negative behaviors. He suggests that boys do best when they are part of a "tribe," three families that include: a birth or adoptive family; an extended family of friends, teachers, peers, and mentors; and the "family" of outside culture, media, religious institutions, and community figures. <i>The Wonder of Boys</i> offers advice on how to understand and build strong father/son and mother/son relationships, stresses the importance of healthy discipline, and suggests methods of teaching boys about sex, relationships, and spirituality. Parents and teachers of boys will find this book to be an insightful read. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i><strong>Michael Gurian </strong>is a psychotherapist and bestselling author whose books include <b>The Wonder of Boys</b> and <b>The Good Son</b>.

Lauren Wagner screamed. Still caught in the web of her nightmare, she shoved at the small hand that held her arm. Jennifer, her younger sister, fell to the ground atop a scattering of pine needles. But Jennifer quickly sprang to her feet and reached out once more.<br>"Jenny," Lauren said, disgusted when she saw what she had done. Her T-shirt was drenched with sweat and her heart was pounding. She gave Jennifer a quick hug. "Are you OK? I didn't mean to push you. I was having a nightmare."<br>"I'm fine," Jennifer said, more serious than startled.<br>"I'm sorry." Lauren busied her hands over her sister's clothes. She realized she was trembling, and had to make a conscious effort to stop. Jennifer watched her closely, her clear blue eyes alert.<br>"You called someone, Lauren," she said. "Whose name did you call?"<br>Lauren hugged her thirteen-year-old sister again, tighter this time, and buried her face in Jennifer's brilliant hair. The chair she had dozed off in rocked forward on the forest floor. "Was I talking in my sleep?" she asked. "I had the strangest dream."<br>Jennifer undid Lauren's hands and took a step back. Behind her, the orange light of the evening sun shone on the tops of the surrounding pine trees. Wash Lake, a hundred yards off to their left, was a deep blue, calm and clear in the quiet of the forest. The fragrance of wild dandelions and blooming sunflowers was in the air. Yet in that moment it seemed to Lauren that Jennifer was not standing in the beautiful mountains of Wyoming, but in another place, a place where there was little beauty, and no sweet smells. Jennifer's gaze was far away and troubled.<br>"Whose name did you call?" Jennifer repeated.<br>Lauren forced a laugh and squeezed Jennifer's shoulders. "You just startled me, is all. That's why I jumped. My dream--why, I can't even remember it. It was nothing. It was only a nightmare."<br>Jennifer looked doubtful. She gestured to stump near Terry's cabin. "I was reading a book. Then you called me."<br>Lauren wanted to change the subject. "What book are you reading?" She started to run her fingers through Jennifer's long blond hair, but Jennifer shook her head and stepped away.<br>"Just a story," she said. "It's nothing." Turning, she walked over to the stump and picked up her book. She sat down and began to read, without looking back up.<br>Lauren frowned. Jennifer was a paradox, she thought, full of joy one moment, troubled and serious the next. Sometimes she wondered if Jennifer spent too much time with her nose in books. It was not unusual for Jennifer to go through five novels a week, all kinds of novels: science fiction, fantasy, adventure books, and westerns. Lauren never censored them. She didn't understand why Jennifer hadn't answered her question.<br>But that reminded Lauren. She still had to read Terry's article. Terry Hayes was her fianc�, a newspaper reporter for the <i>Houston Herald</i>. Lauren picked up the paper from where it had fallen when she jumped up out of her nightmare. The front page was dominated by a color picture that Terry had taken of the crew members of America's first expedition to Mars. Lauren was in the middle, down in front.<br>It was odd--she had been looking at the picture when she had fallen asleep. She knew her nightmare had had something to do with Mars. She called over to Jennifer. "Terry wanted me to critique the second part of his article, but I've only got the first part. Didn't you tell me that boyfriend of yours could get me a copy of the <i>Herald</i>?"<br>Jennifer glanced up and blushed. "He's not my boyfriend."<br>"Then why were you holding his hand?"<br>"I didn't hold his hand. I didn't."<br>"I understand. He was holding your hand."<br>Jennifer had forgotten her book. "Were you spying on us?"<br>"I wouldn't dream of it."<br>"Right," Jennifer said sarcastically.<br>Lauren was thoughtful. "But I do seem to remember seeing him kiss you. Accidentally seeing you, that is. It was on the cheek."<br>"He never!" Jennifer said indignantly.<br>"On the cheek but not far from your lips. A very long kiss, if my memory serves me correctly."<br>Jennifer seemed about to make another sharp retort when she burst out laughing. "You're just jealous because he thinks I'm prettier than you."<br>Lauren blinked, surprised. "He said that?"<br>Jennifer nodded, smug. Of course, Lauren had to agree with the young man. Jennifer was an exceptional beauty, one of those children who could turn a dozen heads in a crowded mall. Her features showed an interesting play of contradictory genes. They were clearly defined, yet also delicate, waiflike. She spent many hours outdoors, and as a result always had a decent tan, which went well with her blue eyes. The latter possessed a cerulean clarity that was seldom found except in newborn babies. But it was her hair that was her crowning glory: long and curly, naturally blond to the point of looking bleached. On sunny days it swirled around her sleek shoulders like a protective aura. To look at Jennifer was to see something beautiful; it was as simple as that.<br>"You told me his name," Lauren said. "What is it? Dave?"<br>"Daniel."<br>"I see, Daniel. Not Dan or Danny, but Daniel."<br>"I thought calling him by his proper name would make him feel more important." Jennifer explained.<br>"Did you read that in a book?"<br>Jennifer shook her head.<br>"Are you sure?" Lauren asked.<br>"No.Yes! I like that name, Daniel."<br>Lauren eyed her sister's discarded book. "What are you reading anyway?"<br>Jennifer bowed her head and touched the book's dull red cover. "Just something I found at the library."<br>"And it's a secret?"<br>Jennifer hesitated. "It's a love story."<br>Lauren laughed. "I bet Danny--Daniel told you to read it. I'm going to make sure Terry watches you closely the next two years." Instantly, Lauren regretted mentioning her leaving, although it was something they had talked about enough. She knew Jennifer preferred not to discuss the expedition to Mars while they were in Wyoming. It was strange--her sister had no trouble with the subject when they were in Houston. Lauren added. "Will Daniel be here soon?"<br>Jennifer brightened. "He said yesterday that he'd be here at six. He's going to show me one of his weapons."<br>"Sounds like a date to me." Lauren checked the position of the sun. "He should be here any minute. Do you want me to take a walk?"<br>"You don't have to," Jennifer said, although she quickly stood, like maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea. Lauren took the hint and got up, tucking Terry's newspaper in her white shorts. The air was warm and dry, and the feel of the sun on her bare legs was delicious.<br>"I need the exercise," Lauren said. "What did you mean, he's going to show you one of his weapons? Is he in the service?"<br>Jennifer giggled. "No. He's only fourteen. He collects weapons. He's part Indian."<br>Lauren nodded. "That explains it. Is he going to show you how to shoot a bow and arrow?"<br>"No. He's bringing an elephant rifle."<br>"Great. My little sister's chasing an Indian who hunts elephants in a pine forest." Jennifer thought that was funny. Lauren continued, "I bought some Cokes in town yesterday, if you want to give your friend a drink. And Jenny, if Terry comes, have Daniel give a blast on his gun."<br>"What if he doesn't bring any bullets?"<br>Lauren was already among the trees, the pine needles crackling under her bare feet. "Then have him send up smoke signals," she called.<br>Soon Lauren reached the shore of the lake, where she turned west, heading in the direction of the sun. It was not long before she entered the shallows and broke into a jog, and then began to run. She loved to race along the shore and feel the sand between her toes and the water splashing up her back. She ran for five hard minutes, and covered at least a mile--for she was in excellent shape, and had always been fast on her feet. She only stopped when she came to wide stream, which from experience she knew to have the slipperiest rocks in all of Wyoming. She had a tiny dent on the back of her skull courtesy of the stream.<br>She was hot, and the lake was tempting. Unfortunately, she didn't have her suit, and her shorts and T-shirt felt like lead weights when they were wet. Plus she was something of a celebrity these days, what with the launch date only a couple of weeks away. It wouldn't do to have one of NASA's leading public relations specimens to be photographed nude.<br><i>Then again, it might do wonders for their budget</i>.<br>Lauren listened closely for a minute, scanning the beach in both directions and finding no one. What decided her in the end was the thought of not seeing any green or open water for two whole years. She had to embrace nature while she could, and if someone did snap her picture, at least she would look like she was having fun. She had her shorts and shirt off in five seconds, and was in water over her head in another ten. It was not merely cold, it was liquid ice, and she loved it. Wash Lake was a half mile across, and she swam strongly toward the center. Had it not been for her bare bottom, she would have tried to swim to the far shore.<br>But her run must have taken more out of her than she realized. Close to the middle of the lake, she found herself working hard, and decided to roll over on her back and take it easy. She drifted along for some time, paddling just enough to stay afloat. Out of the corners of her eyes, the trees looked ten times more distant than they really were, as they always did from surface level. The sky began to darken as the sun slipped behind a forested ridge, and the water temperature finally made itself felt on her muscles. After all the money NASA had invested in her training, it would be a bummer is she drowned. Yet it was with regret that she rolled onto her belly and began to swim toward the shore. She knew even then that she would remember this swim while she was walking across the sands of Mars.<br>Out of the water, Lauren plopped down on a boulder beside the stream and slipped back into her clothes. The evening air held the day's warmth--she didn't mind the damp material clinging to her skin. She had left the paper in the sand. She picked it up and flipped to Terry's article.<br>&nbsp;<br>WAR OF THE WORLDS<br>By Terry Hayes, Reporter<br>&nbsp;<br>Houston. On October 28, 2002, almost two years ago, two Russian spacecraft touched down on Mars, in the mountainous region known as Tharsis. The expedition was headed by Dmitri Maximov. For ten days his men explored the area, beaming to Earth incredible footage of the alien landscape. But then, on November 6, all contact with them was lost. Two days later, communication was also lost with Carl Bensk, the sole cosmonaut aboard the mother ship, in orbit around Mars. Since that time, neither the men on the planet, nor Carl Bensk, have been heard from. They are presumed dead.<br>What happened to them? Five major theories have been put forth to explain their disappearance: 1) mechanical failure; 2) natural calamity; 3) alien infection; 4) alien monsters; and 5) insanity.<br>Of these five theories, the first is thought most likely, but only in the improbable context of the others. The chance of both communication systems on board the landers failing simultaneously is astronomically small. Furthermore, the two craft landed almost a mile apart. If one had exploded during takeoff, the other would have been spared. For the mechanical theory to hold water, the mother ship would also have had to suffer a major system failure. The theory breaks down under even the most casual scrutiny.<br>A natural calamity? Mars is now known to have sandstorms, and earthquakes are much more common there than on Earth. It snowed often while the Russians were in communication. The Tharsis region is also volcanic, or at least it has been in the past. However, satellites circling Mars reported no unusual weather during the period in question, and no obvious eruptions. In either case, the orbiting ship should have been unaffected, and Carl Bensk should still have returned home.<br>Life has never been proven to exist on Mars. Nevertheless, a variety of microscopic organisms could be flourishing in the planet's atmosphere and soil undetected. Our investigation of Mars is still in its infant stages. As is well known, a human being exposed to a virus or a bacteria from an alien environment would have no natural defense. Skeptics of this theory, however, point out that such an infection would have had to strike at lightning speed to prevent the cosmonauts from radioing Earth. Given the harsh Martian environment, advanced forms of life are considered impossible. Plus, of course, none of the Russians saw anything that looked alive. But even if such creatures did exist, they would once again have had to kill at an incredible speed to prevent at least a warning from being sent to Earth. Certainly, no alien's arm could have reached all the way into space and murdered Carl Bensk, not unless the alien was part of an advanced civilization that had mastered the art of invisibility.<br>It must be clear by now that the fundamental criticism of all these theories centers on Mr. Bensk. That is, except for the fifth theory--insanity. The Russians...<br>* * *<br>Lauren dropped the paper with a start as a loud explosion echoed across the lake. Daniel must have brought bullets, she thought. Terry must have arrived. She jumped to her feet and raced down the sandy beach. She ran fast, as hard as she had on the run out, and was gasping for air by the time she caught sight of Jennifer and her friend.<br>But Terry hadn't arrived, after all. Daniel was simply target shooting, using the cans of Coke she had bought yesterday. A handsome boy, he was dark complexioned, and had a remarkably well developed physique for a fourteen-year-old. The rifle he had cocked to his shoulder looked as if it could blow the head off a dinosaur.<br>"I told him you would come if he shot the gun," Jennifer said with a laugh. "Lauren, this is Daniel. Daniel, this is my big sister, Lauren. She's going to Mars in a couple of weeks."<br><i>So what else is new</i>, Lauren thought.<br>Daniel offered his hand. "I know that. I saw you on TV last week. That's great that you're going to Mars. I'd like to go there myself someday."<br>Lauren shook his hand. "Pleased to meet you, Daniel. You'll get to go. In another twenty years they'll probably have tourist flights to Mars."<br>"But Lauren's going to be one of the first there," Jennifer said.<br>"The Russians were the first ones," Daniel said. He added, "Of course, they didn't come back."<br>"No they didn't," Lauren agreed.<br>"That was a lousy way for me to say hello," Daniel said wisely. "Sorry."<br>"That's all right," Lauren said.<br>"It's pretty cold there, isn't it?" Daniel asked.<br>"Our suits will keep us warm," Lauren said. "At least, that's what NASA tells us."<br>"I tried on her helmer," Jennifer broke in.<br>"What was it like?" Daniel asked, interested.<br>"It didn't fit. It was like wearing a bowl over your head. It was fun, though."<br>"We'll see you on TV when you're there, won't we?" Daniel asked.<br>"Yes," Lauren said. "Except you'll see everything twenty minutes after it happens. Even traveling at the speed of light, out radio signals will take that long to reach Earth. You probably know all that stuff."<br>"Yeah," Daniel said. "Pretty long ways to travel. Jenny says yo...</p><h2>Toward the End of Time</h2><p>Ben Turnbull, the hero of John Updike's eighteenth novel, is a sixty-six-year-old retired investment counselor living north of Boston in the year 2020. A recent war between the United States and China has thinned the population and brought social chaos. The dollar has been locally replaced by Massachusetts scrip; instead of taxes, one pays protection money to competing racketeers. Nevertheless, Ben's life, traced by his journal entries over the course of a year, retains many of its accustomed comforts, as supervised by his vibrant wife, Gloria. He plays golf; he pays visits to his five children and ten grandchildren. Something of a science buff, he finds his personal history caught up in the disjunctions and vagaries of the "many-worlds&nbsp;&nbsp;hypothesis derived from the indeterminacy of quantum theory. His identity branches into variants extending back through history and ahead in the evolution of the universe, as both it and his own mortal, nature-enshrouded existence move toward the end of time.</p><p>John Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954, and spent a year in England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <b>The New Yorker</b>, to which he has contributed poems, short stories, essays, and book reviews. Since 1957 he has lived in Massachusetts. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award.Mr. Updike's latest novel opens with a first snowfall and a disagreement between the narrator, a retired financial adviser, and his still very active wife. Ben Turnbull wants to relax and enjoy the natural world. She wants the property to resemble a parquet floor. These people are living, however, in the year 2020. There has been a disastrous Sino-American nuclear war. The remnants of the federal government are holed up somewhere, sending out tax bills that nobody pays. Massachusetts does local business with a scrip called welders. The novel purports to be Ben's journal. There are elements of magic realism in the text, and a few borrowings from science fiction, but futuristic fantasy is the book's basic character. It combines melancholy reflections on the passage of time with the author's mischievously idiosyncratic notions of what will survive Ragnarok. The list includes nagging wives, National Geographic, the North Shore commuter line, opportunistic crime, the pursuit of young girls by old boys, UPS, and the telephone, on which mechanical voices continue to order the pushing of buttons that lead ad infinitum to other mechanical voices. Ben considers history and golf games. He meditates on black holes and his health. He records weather and seasons with precision and lyrical appreciation. He observes that "if not magical, men are not much," and describes a corpse as "this slumped puddle of deactivated molecules." He becomes, without warning or explanation, a man of other times and places. Altogether, he is a fascinating, amusing, eloquent companion, and one feels genuine regret when the year, his journal, and with them Mr. Updike's novel come to an end. -- <i>The Atlantic Monthly, Phoebe-Lou Adams</i><br><br>The future isn't what it used to be. A century ago futuristic novels were radiantly utopian, but as the 20th century clouded over, so did the fictional future.... (Updike's) most recent novel,<i>In the Beauty of the Lilies</i>, rendered four generations of 20th-century Americans with brilliant, Flemish-painting precision. But there was a dark undertone to that novel, and <i>Toward the End of Time</i> picks it up and runs with it all the way into the year 2020. -- <i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br>The branching imagination in this novel--call it Mr. Updike's art--is occupied with roads not taken, and some of them go back a long way, to the author of the Mark gospel, or to a pair of Egyptian tomb-robbers, or to a monk in the Dark Ages about to be extinguished by Norsemen. These transformations, or forkings, are daring; they also make tough going for a first-time reader. Yet when Ben, near the end of the novel, thinks that "the short view alone is bearable," we agree with him, partly because of the long views Mr. Updike takes in his narrative. -- <i>The Wall Street Journal, William H. Pritchard</i><br><br>Updike allows his protagonist some extensive theorizing about his alternate worlds. But, as with the oddly sporadic presentation of a post-nuclear future, we sense that the author is pointing elsewhere.... This makes for some fairly dry work. The balance between giving life to a story and talking at it leans to the side of talk--particularly since it is hard to provide vital distinctness to alternate worlds when you suggest that they may be mental constructs.... Yet, seen not for themselves but as part of Turnbull's aging struggle, the fantasy alternate worlds are truly affecting. Stripped of vitality and power, the failing protagonist makes a final grab for command by using the loopy metaphors of physics to declare reality for the cloudiness of his mind and desires. In his rage against the "dying of the light," he elevates the imminent end of his particular time into the astrophysical hypothesis of the End of Time. -- <i>Los Angeles Times Sunday Book Review, Richard Eder</i></p><h2>The New Zucchini Cookbook</h2><p>Includes more than 190 recipes plus instructions for baking, grilling, saut,ing, stir-frying, stuffing, and tempura. 450,000 copies in print. <p></p></p><p>You learned in the first edition that there is no such thing as too much zucchini.

My mother was one of his seven sisters, and whenever he was in town, we'd all go to see him perform. I loved being backstage near talented people.<br><br>My mother wanted me to go to college. I'd rather have hung out with the guys and played ball, or gone to a poolroom, or chased the girls, but school is what she wanted. When she died young, in July 1937, I immediately dropped out of school and went to work. Another uncle, Willie Burns--George's manager and writer--called Abe Lastfogel, the boss at the William Morris Agency, and asked him to give me a job of any sort. Nat Lefkowitz and Morris Stoller interviewed me, and in August 1937, when I was nineteen, I got a job as an office boy at twelve dollars a week.<br><br>sol leon: I grew up in Brooklyn. My father was in the women's coats and suits business. He was able to put me through the first year of college at NYU-Heights, but when the Depression hit he said, "Sorry. I can't afford to send you back."<br><br>I got a job and went to Brooklyn Law at night. I sat next to Nat Lefkowitz in class for four years; it was alphabetical. Morris Stoller was also there. Lefkowitz and Stoller worked at William Morris; Nat practically ran the place under Bill Morris Jr. When I became disenchanted with the law, I asked him to find a place for me.<br><br>I started October 1, 1938; I was twenty-five. Nat made me head of the mailroom, while Stoller trained me in business affairs. I had nothing directly to do with handling mail. My job was to tear off the Teletypes and distribute them. Get theater tickets. Get train tickets for Mr. Lastfogel; he didn't fly to California then. Anything that had to be delivered or sorted, I'd delegate. I just told the kids what to do.<br><br>weiss: Before Sol Leon came to oversee the mailroom, "Uncle Henry"--Bill Morris Sr.'s wife's cousin--supervised the office boys. He was an elderly guy who didn't hesitate to crack the whip and make sure we weren't off playing cards someplace. I wish now that I had behaved myself better. I wasted a lot of time. I'd rather have gone dancing than deliver a script, listen to great bands and vocalists in Harlem than sort mail. I hung out at the Savoy Ballroom and watched Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald and Ellington. I was also hooked on comics and comedy writers. I loved to go to Lindy's and hang around, try to get myself recognized.<br><br>leon: I wanted to fire Lou Weiss, but I couldn't because he was George Burns's nephew.<br><br>weiss: Maybe because I always dressed better than Sol Leon [laughs]. He'd get very upset.<br><br>larry auerbach: My father was in the dairy restaurant business in Brooklyn. After the stock market crashed, he opened a smaller place but he didn't own the building, and when the city built a new highway, they tore it down, leaving him to sell off his tables and chairs. He was dejected and sad, and the pain of watching him spend more than a year looking for another situation is still vivid.<br><br>I had a work ethic early. When school let out for the summer, I'd always find a job. At twelve I helped my grandparents at their cleaning store, making deliveries. At thirteen I worked for a friend of the family, stacking cans neatly in the Epicurean Department of Gimbel's. The next summer a friend to whom my uncle sold stationery asked me, "Would you like to work in a theatrical agency?"<br><br>I had no idea what that was, so he told me a little bit about it, and I said, "Yeah, it sounds better than delivering suits."<br><br>I got the job at William Morris in June 1944. It was just for the summer, running things around town, mimeographing. I didn't care. It was New York, the big city, exciting and glamorous. I was just shy of fifteen, a little younger than most people in the mailroom. A few years later I was also the youngest ever made an agent at William Morris--to my knowledge. Norman Brokaw claims he was, but what's the difference now?<br><br>hilly elkins: I went to the theater often and from the first was attracted to the idea of putting together what I saw on the stage. When I was fifteen I auditioned for a radio program at WNYC and got in. I ran the sound board, produced, directed, wrote, acted.<br><br>At Brooklyn College my drama coach was Gordon Davidson's dad. Gordon--who has for years been artistic director of the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum of Los Angeles--and I were friends and opened a tent theater in Belle Harbor. I had a combination job: producer, star, and janitor. It didn't lose too much money, but we ran it into the ground.<br><br>I thought maybe learning the agency business would be a good way of getting a rounded entertainment education. People were in either the theater, nightclubs, or motion pictures. But now it was the beginning of television. Milton Berle and the Colgate Comedy Hour. The only players were William Morris and what was then MCA. I thought it was an interesting opportunity.<br><br>I came in cold. Sid Feinberg interviewed me. I was eighteen; I already had my college degree and was starting law school. I gave it up for a job in the mailroom.<br><br>leonard hirshan: I could say I loved movies and went all the time when I was ten years old, and knew about directors and scripts, and loved the actors, and said to my father that one day I would grow up and be an agent--but that's not true. No one tells their parents they want to grow up to be an agent. Until I applied for a job at William Morris, I hadn't the slightest idea of what the agency business was, or any desire to be in show business. The fates pushed me there.<br><br>I got out of the navy in December 1947 and applied to NYU. I'm a very compulsive person, so I went to school all year long and graduated in about half the normal time, in August 1950, on a Friday. Having been accepted at NYU law school, I started the next Monday, but after a few months I burned out. I decided to take a leave of absence after the first semester, get a job for a while, and then go back.<br><br>I asked my uncle, who had booked shows at the Temple Emmanuel, what kind of temporary situations I could find. He lived in the same building as Nat Kalcheim, an important agent at the Morris office, who told him to have me call Sid Feinberg.<br><br>RULE #1<br><br>weiss: We called the boss Mr. Lastfogel, never Abe. Years later I was sitting with him and Elvis' manager, Colonel Parker at Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles, and Colonel Parker said, "Abe, why don't you let Lou call you Abe?"<br><br>Mr. Lastfogel said, "He can call me Abe."<br><br>I said, "I don't call my father Sam. I'm not going to call you Abe."<br><br>It was automatic with all of us.<br><br>hirshan: There was a Nedicks stand in the lobby of our building, 1270 Sixth Avenue, where they sold hot dogs and orange drinks. Whenever I walked by, I'd want something to eat and drink, but I wouldn't do it because I didn't want anyone from the office to think that's where I got my food--until the day I saw Mr. Lastfogel standing there with a hot dog and drink. That's when I realized the democracy of William Morris and dropped all my airs.<br><br>weiss: Mrs. Lastfogel--Frances Arms--was a comic and a performer, and it was rare that she'd ever come up to the office. But one day she did and said, "Get Lou Weiss out of the stockroom." I couldn't imagine what she wanted. To my surprise she said, "Lou, let me see the new dance steps." We put on a record and I danced with the boss's wife. I couldn't say no. Even after I became an agent, whenever she and the boss were in town, she'd say, "Lou, hang around."<br><br>KIDS AT WORK<br><br>weiss: First I was a delivery person. If an actor had to sign a contract, you got on a bus, went to the actor's house. I once waited for Mae West to sign a piece of paper. That was exciting.<br><br>hirshan: I was told to deliver a script to Judy Garland at the Palace Theater. It was a matinee day. I brought it over between shows. I went down to the dumpy-looking dressing rooms, looked in one, and saw a little girl in a ratty bathrobe sitting on the floor watching television. I said, "Excuse me, young lady. Do you know where I can find Judy Garland?" She turned around and said, "I am Judy Garland." It was so embarrassing.<br><br>auerbach: I delivered to Marilyn Monroe. She had just started, but I knew who she was. Her guy at William Morris was Johnny Hyde, a terrific agent, and there was some romance going on between them. I also took something to Gloria DeHaven. She opened the door in her underwear. I was too young to know if I was getting an invitation to come inside, and if I was, I didn't know what to do about it. The only thing I remember is that her underwear was pink. Later I decided that I had really blown it!<br><br>weiss: Belle Baker was not quite Sophie Tucker, but she was an important client who'd made a name for herself in vaudeville. She had an apartment on Central Park West. I had to get her to sign a contract. Her little dog yapped the whole time I stood in the vestibule. When I went out, the dog bit me. I stood there, my leg bleeding, afraid to go back in. At the office I told Morris Stoller what had happened.<br><br>He sent me to a doctor, who said the board of health had to get the dog. But Belle Baker had left town. They found her working in Atlantic City. They grabbed the dog and checked it out for hydrophobia. Thank God it was clean.<br><br>auerbach: By 1944, Sid Feinberg, a lovely man, oversaw the trainees. He was deathly afraid of Nat Lefkowitz, his boss. There was a cutout window between their offices, and when Nat would open it and say, "Sid!" he'd jump. Sid had th...</p><h2>Civil War: The History of England Volume III (The History of England)</h2><p>In Civil War, Peter Ackroyd continues his dazzling account of England&#39;s history, beginning with the progress south of the Scottish king, James VI, who on the death of Elizabeth I became the first Stuart king of England, and ends with the deposition and flight into exile of his grandson, James II. The Stuart dynasty brought together the two nations of England and Scotland into one realm, albeit a realm still marked by political divisions that echo to this day. More importantly, perhaps, the Stuart era was marked by the cruel depredations of civil war, and the killing of a king. Ackroyd paints a vivid portrait of James I and his heirs. Shrewd and opinionated, the new King was eloquent on matters as diverse as theology, witchcraft and the abuses of tobacco, but his attitude to the English parliament sowed the seeds of the division that would split the country in the reign of his hapless heir, Charles I. Ackroyd offers a brilliant - warts and all - portrayal of Charles&#39;s nemesis Oliver Cromwell, Parliament&#39;s great military leader and England&#39;s only dictator, who began his career as a political liberator but ended it as much of a despot as &#39;that man of blood&#39;, the king he executed. England&#39;s turbulent seventeenth century is vividly laid out before us, but so too is the cultural and social life of the period, notable for its extraordinarily rich literature, including Shakespeare&#39;s late masterpieces, Jacobean tragedy, the poetry of John Donne and Milton and Thomas Hobbes&#39; great philosophical treatise, Leviathan. Civil War also gives us a very real sense of the lives of ordinary English men and women, lived out against a backdrop of constant disruption and uncertainty.</p><p>Peter Ackroyd is an award-winning novelist, as well as a broadcaster, biographer, poet and historian. He is the author of the acclaimed non-fiction bestsellers, Thames: Sacred River and London: The Biography. He holds a CBE for services to literature and lives in London.</p><h2>No Clue at the Inn</h2><p><p>Cecily Baxter and her husband, Hugh, haven't been back to Badgers End in two years-not since they sold the Pennyfoot Hotel and the new owner turned it into a country club.

And end-of-the-millennium blast. The party to end all parties. It&#39;s bound to be the wildest night of their lives. The kind of night when anything--make that everything--could happen. But not everyone is going to live to ring in the new year....</p><p><i>"You're gonna regret not inviting me to your New Year's Eve party,"</i> the creepy female voice shrieked into Lila Fowler's ear. <i>"You're gonna regret it big time!"</i><br><br>Lila rolled her eyes, clicked off her cell phone, and dropped it back inside her Kate Spade bag. <i>Yeah, right,</i> she thought. <i>Like I'll regret not inviting to my bash a pathetic loser who makes crank phone calls.</i><br><br>"Who was that?" Jessica Wakefield asked, pulling open the door to the Sweet Valley Esplanade. "Bruce, with his ETA for tonight?"<br><br><i>I wish,</i> Lila mused, the image of her gorgeous boyfriend popping into her mind. <i>Why hasn't he called yet?</i> "Wrong number," she lied as she and her best friend entered the exclusive shopping mall. She wasn't about to make a big deal over some prank caller--even though that was the second call she'd received today from the loser. And even though it was only 10 A.M.<br><br>Lila could tell that the caller was trying to disguise her voice, but something about the high-pitched female shriek sounded familiar. Oddly familiar.<br><br><i>Whatever,</i> she thought, unwilling to waste another second thinking about the pathetic creature. After all, today was the greatest day-to-be. Not only was Lila throwing the most anticipated New Year's Eve party in Sweet Valley, but her boyfriend was finally coming home for the first time in three months.<br><br>She hadn't seen Bruce Patman since late summer, when he left for his year of studying abroad in France. She'd been waiting for his call all morning, dying to hear his voice, dying to know what time he'd arrive in Sweet Valley, dying to know that she'd see him in mere hours.<br><br>But twice her cell phone had rung this morning, and twice it had been Ms. Pathetic Loser.<br><br>"I'm so psyched for tonight!" Jessica said with a huge grin as they headed for The Zone, where they'd arranged to meet their friends, fellow sorority sisters Denise Waters and Alexandra Rollins and Theta Alpha Theta wanna-be Chloe Murphy, plus Jessica's twin sister, Elizabeth. "All our friends, the hottest guys at SVU, no parents, great music, the best munchies, sleeping till noon the next day. Your party is gonna be so amazing! "<br><br>It was going to be amazing--Lila had made triple sure of that. She'd hired the best caterer and the coolest DJ and invited only SVU's elite--as she determined elite, of course. Every single person she'd sent an invitation to (forty, to be exact) had accepted, which was as expected. And those who hadn't been invited were pissed off, naturally. Like the pathetic loser who kept calling and making that all too clear. Annoying as the calls were, Lila did understand why those who hadn't been invited were miffed.<br><br>A Lila Fowler event was a big deal on SVU's campus and in Sweet Valley. The Fowlers were one of the richest families in southern California, and Lila, if she did say so herself, was one of the most popular girls at Sweet Valley University. Like her friends, Lila was just a sophomore, but she was a Theta, which was only the most elite sorority at SVU, and she was incredibly good-looking and stylish. Lila didn't consider that the least bit conceited, thinking of herself that way. It was the truth. And if there was one thing Lila Fowler was into, besides the best, it was the truth.<br><br>So for forty lucky people, Lila's party was the hottest ticket in town. Her parents were vacationing in Greece for the holidays, and the servants had all been given the night off. Lila and her friends had the Fowler mansion to themselves.<br><br>"Hey, guys!" Jessica waved at the four girls awaiting them.<br><br>"I love Denise dearly," Lila whispered as they headed over to the group, "but how the girl can wear a sweatshirt to this mall is beyond me."<br><br>"The president of Theta Alpha Theta can wear whatever she wants, Lila," Jessica pointed out with a flip of her light blond hair. "Besides, at least it's a <i>Theta</i> sweatshirt."<br><br>"So what's your sister's excuse?" Lila deadpanned, gesturing at Elizabeth in her baggy jeans and SVU sweatshirt. "You'd think living with you in that off-campus house would have rubbed some style off on her."<br><br>Lila would never understand how identical twins could be so different. She'd known the Wakefield sisters her whole life, and they'd been like night and day forever. Where Jessica was fun loving and daring, into clothes, guys, and hanging out, Elizabeth was serious and responsible, into studying, wearing sweatshirts, and telling Jessica when she was out of line.<br><br>"Leave Lizzie alone," Jessica scolded with a grin, her blue-green eyes sparkling.<br><br>As Jessica rushed over to greet their friends, Lila took a minute to pull out her digital party planner and scan her checklist with eagle eyes. <i>Very good,</i> she complimented herself. <i>You've taken care of everything. The only thing you need to do today is buy a pair or two of hot new shoes, have lunch with your buds, wait for Bruce's call, and then primp for a few hours before you greet your guests . . . before you see Bruce again . . . .</i> With a satisfied smile she dropped the planner into her handbag.<br><br>Very soon all six-feet-two of him, with his dark brown hair and slate blue eyes, would be within seeing distance, within hugging distance, kissing distance. They'd party the night away, ring in the new year, and spend the first day of next year in each other's arms . . . . He'd be so happy to see her that he'd vow never to leave her again.<br><br><i>Three whole months!</i> Lila could hardly believe she'd managed to survive this long without him. <i>Barely survived,</i> she amended. The first half of her sophomore year hadn't exactly been any fun without him around. First off, she'd missed him like crazy. Second, all her friends ever wanted to do was hang out and scope for guys, which Lila wasn't into.<br><br>So while her buds flirted the night away with SVU's hottest guys, Lila had often found herself sitting in a corner of whatever bar or club they'd gone to, fantasizing about Bruce. She'd never had any interest in flirting with guys, even innocently. There was nothing innocent about flirting--everyone knew that.<br><br>She loved Bruce. Loved him so much, she couldn't even believe it.<br><br>And he was coming home to her tonight. <i>Finally.</i><br><br>"Hey, Lila," Alexandra called out as Lila approached the group. "So when's Bruce due in? You must be so psyched to see him."<br><br>Lila smiled and patted her handbag. "Got my trusty cell phone, so just waiting for his call," she replied.<br><br>"It feels like forever since I saw him last," Denise said, pushing a strand of brown hair behind her ear.<br><br>"Three months," Jessica chimed in. "That <i>is</i> forever in Boyfriendville. Although Lila Fowler being deprived of anything is pretty funny!"<br><br>Elizabeth laughed. <i>Well, at least Ms. Responsibility has a sense of humor after all,</i> Lila thought, <i>even if it's at my expense.</i><br><br>"Watch it, Wakefields," she told both of them with a slight grin.<br><br>Chloe, Denise, and Alexandra giggled. "So, let's hit the stores!" Alexandra exclaimed.<br><br>"Hey, is everything all set for tonight?" Chloe asked Lila. "I, like, am so unbelievably amazed that I'm invited. Me, just a <i>freshman</i> and everything! It's so amazing that you invited me, Lila, although since we <i>did</i> go to finishing school together and since our families are, like, best friends, I guess you figured you had to."<br><br>Lila rolled her eyes. How did Chloe get all that out in one breath?<br><br>"Chloe," Jessica said, "I'm sure Lila invited you because she <i>wanted</i> to."<br><br>"Yeah, because Lila doesn't do anything out of obligation!" Alexandra piped up.<br><br>"Um, are you guys actually friends?" Elizabeth asked, eyebrow raised as she looked over the group.<br><br>"Chill, Liz," Jessica told her. "We're just kidding with each other. We all know we love each other."<br><br>"Chloe, my dear," Lila said, "Alex is absolutely right. And so's Jess. And yes, everything is ready."<br><br>Her friends had heard every detail about every detail about tonight's bash; the minutest minutiae had been scrutinized. Lila was more than ready for tonight.<br><br>She patted her handbag again, willing it to ring, willing it to be Bruce.<br><br>"So let's hit our favorite clothes store!" Lila said, and the girls raced into Nina-Nina's.<br>"What's up with skirt lengths this season?" Jessica muttered, raking through a rack of above the knee, at the knee, below the knee, calf length, and ankle length.<br><br>"This is <i>so</i> you, Jess." Denise handed Jessica an adorable red-and-pink-print minidress.<br><br>"Ooooh. Cute." Jessica snatched the dress and disappeared into the dressing room. She shimmied into it, loving the feel of the stretchy material against her skin. It was sexy, but not too much, which was perfect for tonight.<br><br>Jessica was looking forward to ringing in the new year surrounded by Sweet Valley's hottest guys. But she wasn't looking for a boyfriend. All she wanted was a little flirt action.<br><br>The old Jessica Wakefield would have grabbed the hottest dress to score the hottest guy. But the new Jessica was a little more mature, a little more serious, a little more discriminating--about her clothes and her guys. Her track record in the man department wasn't so great, even after she'd vowed to be a more grown-up Jessica for her sophomore year. She was definitely taking a break from falling in love. And this cute dress was the kind that attracted <i>like,</i> not <i>love.</i> Jessica stepped out from behind the curtain and preened in front of the three-way mirror.<br><br>"Hey, I'm trying on that dress!" Elizabeth announced as she came into the dressing room. "That dress is so <i>me</i></p><h2>A Cotswold Killing (Cotswold Mysteries)</h2><p>Nestled in the fertile hills of the Cotswolds, the village of Duntisbourne Abbots is a well-kept secret: beautiful, timeless and quintessentially English.

Capitalizing on the success of <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, her propaganda film for the Nazi Party, Riefenstahl secured Hitler's approval for her grandiose plans to film the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The result was a work as notorious for its politics as celebrated for its aesthetic power. Taylor Downing provides an indispensable guide to this major work of film documentary. He gives the full story of how Riefenstahl negotiated relative independence from the Nazi authorities by pitting Hitler against Goebbels, the propaganda minister, who wanted complete control. Downing also gives a filmmaker's insights into the logistical and technical problems thrown up by managing a production which employed nearly forty cameramen to shoot 400,000 metres of film. He concludes that though its political effect was to glorify Nazi achievements, the film undeniably set the standard for Olympic filmmaking for the next five decades.</p><p>Taylor Downing is a writer and a documentary filmmaker who filmed at both the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.</p><h2>Sideways: A Novel</h2><p><i>Sideways</i> is the story of two friends-Miles and Jack-going away together for the last time to steep themselves in everything that makes it good to be young and single: pinot, putting, and prowling bars. In the week before Jack plans to marry, the pair heads out from Los Angeles to the Santa Ynez wine country. For Jack, the tasting tour is Seven Days to D-Day, his final stretch of freedom. For Miles--who has divorced his wife, is facing an uncertain career and has lost his passion for living-the trip is a weeklong opportunity to evaluate his past, his future and himself. <br><br>A raucous and surprising novel filled with wonderful details about wine, <i>Sideways</i> is also a thought-provoking and funny book about men, women, and human relationships.<br></p><p>Rex Pickett lives in Los Angeles, CA. This is his first novel.<br>Miles, a self-loathing oenophile, has 35 rejection slips stuck to the walls of his dismal apartment and is desperate to hear from his agent, who just told him: "Richard Davis at Conundrum liked your book." Jack is a self-loving actor desperate to get laid before he marries Babs at the end of the week. Together they head into Santa Ynez wine country, desperate for pinot and a chance--maybe the last chance--to connect as friends. The novel is funny, sad, and good-hearted, as was the Indie movie whose screenplay won the Oscar for best adaptation. Golden Voice Scott Brick punches out every line. His delivery holds the reader's attention but damages the story in spots, since the light, ironic touches are blown away.

Practising the biodynamic method of agriculture - sometimes referred to as &#39;premium organic&#39; - he is at the forefront of a movement to return to the concept of terroir, as full expression and embodiment of a particular grape-growing locality, or appelation. Today even expensive wines, made under strictly regulated controls and standards, are tainted by the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and manipulated in the cellar through the use of osmosis and the additions of aromatic yeasts and enzymes. To counter such trends, a new &#39;Charter of Quality&#39;, run by organic and biodynamic viticulturists, guarantees that the appelation comes to full, authentic expression. To aid this process, biodynamic winegrowers like Joly use special planting methods and preparations that enhance and invigorate the soil, bringing it into harmony with the forces of sun, moon and cosmos to embed the vine in a rich, living context.</p><p>NICOLAS JOLY, born in 1945, has been working with biodynamics for over 25 years, and is widely recognized as one of France&#39;s foremost winemakers. Following his studies at Columbia University, he joined JP Morgan in New York. He was posted to London, but left in 1977 to run his family&#39;s vineyard, Coulee de Serrant. Having worked with modern agriculture and observed its negative effects on nature, he came across a book on biodynamic farming and began experimenting, fascinated by the ideas he found there. Later, he discovered and connected with a movement based on the work of the founder of biodynamics, Rudolf Steiner. He faced much opposition until the end of the 1990s, when the quality of his wines, with their unique and authentic appellations, spoke for themselves. Nicholas Joly now teaches around the world as one of the pioneers of biodynamic viticulture.&#39;Nicolas Joly is right: he is not a winemaker. He is a thinker, a talker and an idealist, with a captivating passion for his work. His wine is simply the end result of a much greater process.&#39; - DECANTER &#39;Under Joly&#39;s biodynamic care, this historic vineyard produces one of the most distinctive and expressive wines of the Loire.&#39; - WINE AND SPIRIT &#39;The quartet of his 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 vintages may have been the greatest white wine produced in France. The incredible splendour of the bodies of these wines sends all the other famous vintages back to school.

Beginning with a playful ant and an orange-and-purple butterfly, two to three animals and their first letters are introduced on each spread. As the menagerie multiplies, the creatures move around the pages, sometimes interacting with humorous results. The frog extends its long pink tongue toward the tasty ant; a few spreads later, the iguana's tongue angles lustily after the same unsuspecting insect, which is trying to hide behind the lizard's front leg. While many of the critters are obvious and familiar, some, like the quail, vulture, xenops, or yak, may need to be identified on the final pages, where each animal is labeled. Readers will also have to hunt for some that are cleverly hidden, like the elephants that suddenly appear as a border pattern around the edge of a bowl and the unicorn etched on a spoon. The playful gouache illustrations depict the colorful crew having as much fun as readers will surely have identifying them. A lively choice for group or one-on-one sharing.<i>&#x2013;Barbara Auerbach, New York City Public Schools</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are also more than 2,300 detailed notes explaining practically every line of the poems. The notes are based on Mohammad Sudi s authoritative commentary.

Roger Bannister, the British middle-distance runner who finally achieved the epic quest in 1954, wrote this stunning memoir of his life as a runner a year later; intelligent, analytical, dramatic, and graceful, it remains a sporting classic. Though two introductions have been added in years since, it&#39;s a shame that Bannister, a remarkable man who graduated from Oxford to a distinguished medical career, has never penned a more complete memoir. Still, his achievement as a young man remains one of the pivotal moments in 20th-century sports, and his account of that achievement is as good a glimpse into a runner&#39;s race toward greatness as has ever been written.All sports have pivotal moments, single events that change perceptions forever after. For the sport of running, such a moment occurred on a blustery May afternoon in 1954, when Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile. This is the story of that epic run.<br>Today, more than fifty years later, lovers of the sport&#x2014;runners and non-runners alike&#x2014;will be moved by this modest but impassioned story of one of sport&#x2019;s true heroes.</p><h2>The Creation Records Story</h2><p>The history of Creation Records is equal parts black comedy, tragedy, farce and urban myth - laced with orgiastic quantities of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.

This practical, easy-to-use cookbook is full of recipes (more than 900!) which can be made without elaborate preparation.

Where we once invited "company" home for Sunday dinner, today we are more likely to share a carry-in lunch in the church fellowship hall after morning worship.<br>It's a custom worth fostering, we believe, especially when we see so little of each other apart from Sunday morning. Furthermore, it seems more appropriate to relax in the spirit of community rather than to be entertained by one starring (and probably tense and exhausted!) cook.<br><b>Familiar Favorites</b><br>Collected here are favorite recipes from Mennonite fellowship meals, offered by the cooks who prepare them. "People ask me to bring this," some explained with gentle pride. "I love watching people go for this dish," or "I take this because I never have any leftovers," admitted others!<br><b>A Multi-Cultural Event</b><br>Food fuels friendships and begins to undo prejudices. In that spirit, this book contains favorite dishes from the many food traditions which are now part of the Mennonite family of faith. In some places throughout North America, Mennonite fellowship meals are multi-cultural events, reflecting the make-up of their congregations. Experiment with the Lao, Chinese, Belizean, Mexican, Native-American and African-American dishes that are part of this collection.<br><b>For Eating at Home</b><br>Not only are all these recipes fellowship meal favorites, they also feed family and friends equally well at home. One note if you prepare these dishes for eating at home -- the number of servings included with each recipe assumes the traditional bounty of a fellowship meal. Consequently, we have assumed more servings per recipe than is likely to be adequate for home use. <br><b>About Titling Recipes</b><br>While most Mennonite cooks take pride in the food they fix, they are also a modest lot. We took one liberty as editors that may challenge the humility of a few who submitted recipes to us: in some cases we included the name of the submitter in the title of the recipe, in an effort to distinguish it from similar surrounding recipes. (We figured that was in keeping with our tradition of crediting the maker of a favorite dish by the name we give it -- "Aunt Anna May's Snickerdoodles," for example.) We do apologize if we have embarrassed anyone with this decision.<br><b>If You're in Charge</b><br>In the interest of easing your planning for a fellowship meal we have included a chapter about overcoming common hurdles -- what to do when your oven space is limited; what if there are too few electrical outlets; how to overcome tight quarters for eating.<br><b>If You Don't Know What to Make</b><br>To give you inspiration when you've been asked to bring finger food, when you're looking for something children will enjoy or when you want to make an unusual dish, we offer special indexes at the back of the book to those categories, plus several others.<br>May you find this food delectable and nourishing, not only for your bodies, but for your friendships and families also. There is incomparable warmth in eating together. This is food for fellowship.

It&#x2019;s thick and calm and quiet and peaceful in the fog, there where the piney woods that stretch on east into Louisiana give way somewhat abruptly to blackland prairies that spread west all the way to Dallas and beyond. She almost can&#x2019;t see her hand held out of the open car door in front of her own face. It&#x2019;s that thick. </p><p>And even better, surely no one can see her sitting here in this car on this dirt side road off another dirt side road, not far from the river bottoms. Sure, her leg that was burned badly a few months back still hurts and the other hip hurts even more from the rheumatism that flared up only recently. Rheumatism, at only twenty-three years old, no less. Too much sitting in cold cars. Too much sleeping in cold cars! But even with the pain, it&#x2019;s a comfort to know she can&#x2019;t be seen parked here in a cloud at daybreak, like a ghost in heaven. It&#x2019;s chilly, this cloud on the ground, but it&#x2019;s safe, and if death is like this fog it might not be so bad. </p><p>Only it&#x2019;s not worth thinking about death. That&#x2019;s the rule. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s don&#x2019;t be sad,&#x201c; she said to her mother only a few months before when the subject came up. We&#x2019;re here now. We&#x2019;re alive. </p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s don&#x2019;t be sad&#x201d; is what she said. </p><p>It&#x2019;s like thinking about air, for God&#x2019;s sake. And why think about air? Death and air. Fog, though, is good. Thick and quiet, except for now and then an occasional <em>tick ticka tick </em>of the steel in the car that says the sun has risen, even if she can&#x2019;t see it rising. </p><p>When you&#x2019;re standing in a cold ditch in fog so thick you can&#x2019;t even see the car only a few yards away it&#x2019;s amazing where your mind will want to wander. Standing there with a fat automatic rifle in your hand waiting, what has it been now, ten minutes, an hour? Could be either. But you don&#x2019;t let your mind wander for the same reason you don&#x2019;t drink much moonshine even when everyone else does. Or, rather, you don&#x2019;t drink it <em>especially </em>when everyone else does. Even when Bonnie does. She likes it sometimes, but you know it dulls the senses, slows you down, gets you caught, gets you killed. So you don&#x2019;t drink much moonshine and you don&#x2019;t let your mind wander through the fog. </p><p>Where are they? Should be any minute now. </p><p>Eastham Farm, burnin&#x2019; Eastham, bloody burnin&#x2019; Eastham Prison Farm. This breakout was your idea in the first place, you and Fults thought it up together. But that was back a few years, back when you were still a prisoner on the inside. Not out here and free. Ha! FREE! As much as being on the run from the laws is freedom. Yeah, what a wonderful freedom this is: being wanted, being wounded, being hot as hell in three states, four, five states, whatever. Feels like you and Bonnie are hot as hell everywhere. Hot right in this ditch in the chilly fog a mile from the burnin&#x2019; hell. Oh they&#x2019;d love to find you here, for sure. </p><p>But you weren&#x2019;t thinking how it would feel to get this close to this place again when you said let&#x2019;s do it. No way. And you weren&#x2019;t thinking you would be here with this pathetic drug addict Mullins instead of Fults or Raymond or someone you don&#x2019;t have to watch every second, someone who&#x2019;s likely to turn rat just for another hit of dope. </p><p>It&#x2019;s amazing what a man can force himself not to remember most days and nights, except when it creeps up. And standing here in a ditch so close to it all, to where most of it all happened anyway, some of it does creep up no matter how you fight it. Burnin&#x2019; Eastham. Burnin&#x2019; hell. </p><p>Sure, you have killed a few men, more than a few, but you&#x2019;re not a killer at heart. Not according to your friends, anyway. This is not to say that you&#x2019;re afraid to pull the trigger when it has to be pulled. And not to say that you don&#x2019;t like the look of fear in big cops&#x2019; faces when a gun&#x2019;s pointing their way. (If they&#x2019;d look a little more afraid and not be reaching for their own guns all the time, you tell your friend, the trigger might not need pulling so often.) You pull the trigger, sure. It&#x2019;s just that there&#x2019;s no pleasure in it, even when it has to happen. So you&#x2019;re not a killer, right? </p><p>But when those memories do creep up, you start to think about those guards and their finks, their chains and their bats. And their &#x201c;trusties&#x201d; who will sit on your head while the man&#x2014;the &#x201c;captain&#x201d;&#x2014;whips you with the strap. And even worse sometimes is what goes on when the guards aren&#x2019;t around. </p><p>When those memories creep up....Those guys, well, they deserve whatever comes their way. At least as much as you do. </p><p>The guards at Eastham Prison Farm, some thirty miles north of the main Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, hate that fog but are pretty well used to it. Running the boys out the two miles or so to the work site from the building in dim dawn light and fog means riding closer to the jogging squad than the guards want to ride, just so they can see the boys clearly. Closer to the convicts means the convicts are closer to the guards, closer to their reins and closer to their bridles. Closer to the loaded Smith &amp; Wesson .38s in their holsters. Closer to the shotguns, though with those right in a guard&#x2019;s lap all day, he is damned well likely to get a blast off if a prisoner is stupid enough to try to come near it. </p><p>Or not. Trouble comes fast in fog. On a foggy morning just like this, in fact, an Eastham guard named John Greer rides into the middle of his squad, all fired up to give the lazy bastards a piece of his mind, and maybe a piece of the bat for milling around instead of chopping weeds. Only instead of pistol-whipping some sorry two-time loser across the side of the head as planned, it&#x2019;s suddenly Greer who is pulled off his horse and passed around a circle of convicts, like some Julius Caesar, to be stabbed one at a time with homemade dirk knives. Greer doesn&#x2019;t even get a single shot off and he winds up dead with no witnesses as to who exactly did it. Funny how you can have lots of killers but no witnesses at all. Not that someone at burnin&#x2019; Eastham won&#x2019;t be made to pay hell for the killing of a guard. </p><p>This foggy morning another guard, whose name is Olin Bozeman, isn&#x2019;t going to make that particular mistake. He&#x2019;ll make a different one, which he&#x2019;ll live to regret, and one of his fellow guards, Major Crowson, will make an even dumber move that he won&#x2019;t live to regret because he won&#x2019;t live. No, as a general rule the guards don&#x2019;t ever want to be too close to a squad of felons armed with hoes and other tools, not to mention guns snuck in from outside. Guns that the guards know nothing about until the cold barrel is pointed straight at them by a man who may hate them enough to kill them or may not, but who is desperate to get out by whatever means necessary. </p><p>But Eastham guards still have to be able to count the boys as they jog along. So the thicker the fog, the closer they have to stay. </p><p>Seems like counting is most of a guard&#x2019;s job most of the days. Over and over again, for fourteen or sixteen hours a day, for a few bucks&#x2019; pay to feed a family they only get to see every other night at best, and an occasional Sunday. A guard gets his breakfast before dawn in the guards&#x2019; dining room, gets his horse after breakfast from the lot boy, who has the animal all saddled up and waiting, gets his shotgun from the picket, and just about the first words he hears spoken is the trusty yelling out the number of men coming out of the tank for their squad. </p><p>&#x201c;Eighteen, Boss,&#x201c; he says, or whatever the number of the day is, and they count them coming out of the door in their white suits for those that haven&#x2019;t tried to run in the past and their striped suits for those that have run off and been caught. </p><p>&#x201c;One, two, three, four, five, six...&#x201d; until they get them all and can yell back &#x201c;Eighteen,&#x201c; to let them know inside the building they got the same number outside, as if someone could get lost in the doorway. Then all day on the horse with that shotgun in one hand and the reins in another, come hot sun or come thick fog, they count those boys over and over until lunch. </p><p>The only reason the guards might run in sooner than lunch is come hail or rain. They got hail around here can kill a man once in a while, and lightning: an Eastham guard named Sye Fulsom once saw a convict get zapped right off the water wagon. Scared the shit out of the mules, literally. </p><p>On a normal day, though, it&#x2019;s work the squad hard until lunch and then run them back to the building, yell &#x201c;Eighteen coming in&#x201d; and hear the voice come out &#x201c;Eighteen, Boss&#x201d; when the men are in the door again. Lunch is usually ham and beans, but it&#x2019;s better than the squad is getting, and for that a guard in these times can be thankful. And maybe there&#x2019;s a moment for a catnap or at least a few minutes of horizontal in the guards&#x2019; bunkhouse before it&#x2019;s time to get the horse and get the shotgun. (The pistol never leaves his side. &#x201c;Goes to bed with you, gets up with you, and goes to the long table with you,&#x201c; says a guard who was there. &#x201c;Boy, it damn near grows into you.&#x201d;) Then it&#x2019;s back to &#x201c;Eighteen, Boss&#x201d; out the door and &#x201c;Eighteen&#x201d; called back in. Back out to fields in summer or the woodlots in winter for the afternoon&#x2019;s work session. </p><p>That would be the afternoon and evening&#x2019;s work. &#x201c;Can to can&#x2019;t&#x201d; is what the prisoners call the workday on burnin&#x2019; Eastham, meaning the work goes &#x201c;from the time they can see until they cannot.&#x201d; </p><p>...</p></p><h2>No Flying in the Hall (Mercer Mayer&#39;s Critters of the Night) (A Random House Pictureback; #5)</h2><p>Thistle Howl attends witch's school and <i>unwitchingly</i> turns Miss Prickly and Miss Prune into toads while trying to make Magic Potion Number Nine.

Here the charismatic leader of the Slow Food movement, Carlo Petrini, outlines many different routes by which we may take back control of our food. The three central principles of the Slow Food plan are these: food must be sustainably produced in ways that are sensitive to the environment, those who produce the food must be fairly treated, and the food must be healthful and delicious. In his travels around the world as ambassador for Slow Food, Petrini has witnessed firsthand the many ways that native peoples are feeding themselves without making use of the harmful methods of the industrial complex. He relates the wisdom to be gleaned from local cultures in such varied places as Mongolia, Chiapas, Sri Lanka, and Puglia. Amidst our crisis, it is critical that Americans look for insight from other cultures around the world and begin to build a new and better way of eating in our communities here.</p><p><b>Carlo Petrini</b> is the founder and driving force of Slow Food and was recently acclaimed as a great innovator in <i>Time magazine's</i> list of "European Heroes."&#x201c;Petrini builds his case against fast food and offers ways to bring back the balance between nature and our table.&#x201d; ~<i>Bon Appetit<br></i><br>&#x201c;The book is an earthly, through treatise on eating well.&#x201d; ~<i>Whole Living<br><br></i>&#x201c;In <i>Slow Food Nation</i>, Petrini demonstrates the ultimate mission of the Slow Food Movement by exposing the dangers of the food industry, which include genetically modified organisms, chemicals, and pesticides.&#x201d; ~<i>WholeFoods Magazine<br></i></p><h2>The Triumph of Caesar: A Novel of Ancient Rome (Novels of Ancient Rome)</h2><p><p>The Roman civil war has come to its conclusion &#x2013; Pompey is dead, Egypt is firmly under the control of Cleopatra (with the help of Rome&#x2019;s legions), and for the first time in many years Julius Caesar has returned to Rome&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;Appointed by the Senate as Dictator, the city abounds with rumors asserting that Caesar wishes to be made King &#x2013; the first such that Rome has had in centuries.&nbsp;And that not all of his opposition has been crushed.</p><p>Gordianus, recently returned from Egypt with his wife Bethesda, is essentially retired from his previous profession of &#x2018;Finder&#x2019; but even he cannot refuse the call of Calpurnia, Caesar&#x2019;s wife. Troubled&nbsp; by dreams foretelling disaster and fearing a conspiracy against the life of&nbsp;Caesar, she had hired someone to investigate the rumors. But that person, a close friend of Gordianus, has just turned up dead &#x2013; murdered -- on her doorstep. With four successive Triumphs for Caesar&#x2019;s&nbsp;military&nbsp;victories scheduled for the coming days, and Caesar more exposed to danger than ever before, Calpurnia wants Gordianus to uncover the truth behind the rumored conspiracies -- to protect Caesar&#x2019;s life, before it is too late. No fan of Caesar&#x2019;s, Gordianus agrees to help &#x2013; but only to find the murderer who killed his friend. But once an investigation is begun, there's no controlling what it will turn up, who it will put in danger, and where it will end.</p></p><p>Steven Saylor&nbsp;is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Roma</i> as well as the previous books in the <i>Roma Sub Rosa</i> series featuring Gordianus the Finder.

There was only one chair. She sat. I stood and tried not to fidget while the most powerful woman in Rome looked me up and down. <p></p><p></p>"Yes, I'm sure one of my agents told me you drowned in the Nile," she said, gazing at me shrewdly. "Yet here you stand before me, Gordianus, as alive as ever&#x2014;unless those Egyptians have learned to bring the dead back to life, not just mummify them." She fixed her chilly gaze on my face. "How old are you, Finder?" <p></p><p></p>"Sixty-four." <p></p><p></p>"No! Have the Egyptians found a way to restore a man's youth? You look very fit for a man your age. You're ten years older than my husband, yet I daresay you look ten years younger." <p></p><p></p>I shrugged. "Great Caesar carries the weight of the whole world on his shoulders. His enemies have been destroyed, but his responsibilities are greater than ever. The worries and cares of the world's master must be endless. My humble life has taken a different course. My obligations grow less, not more. I've had my share of strife, but now I'm at peace with the world and with myself. For the time being, at least . . ." <p></p><p></p>Having been summoned by Caesar's wife, I had to wonder if the tranquillity of my life was about to be sorely disrupted. <p></p><p></p>"When did I last see you, Gordianus?" <p></p><p></p>"It must have been almost exactly two years ago, just before I left for Egypt." <p></p><p></p>She nodded. "You went there because your wife was unwell." <p></p><p></p>"Yes. Bethesda was born in Egypt. She believed that she could be cured of her illness only by bathing in the waters of the Nile. The cure apparently worked, because&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"Yet you spent most of your time in the city of Alexandria, along with my husband," she said, showing no interest in Bethesda's cure. <p></p><p></p>"Yes. I arrived in the midst of the civil war between Queen Cleopatra and her siblings. During the siege that confined Caesar to the royal palace for several months, I was trapped there as well." <p></p><p></p>"Where you became quite friendly with my husband." <p></p><p></p>"I had the privilege of conversing with him on numerous occasions," I said, evading the topic of friendship. My feelings toward Caesar were more complicated than that. <p></p><p></p>"Eventually, my husband was victorious in Egypt, as he's been victorious in every other campaign. He put an end to the civil strife in Alexandria . . . and installed young Cleopatra on the throne." <p></p><p></p>She spoke the queen's name with a grimace; Caesar's adulterous love affair with Cleopatra, who claimed to have borne his child, was a favorite topic of every scandalmonger in Rome. The grimace deepened the wrinkles on her face, and Calpurnia suddenly looked much older than when I had last seen her. She had never been a beautiful woman; Caesar had not married her for her looks but for her respectability. His previous wife had embarrassed him by falling prey to gossip. "Caesar's wife," he had declared, "must be above suspicion." Calpurnia proved to be hardheaded, pragmatic, and ruthless; Caesar had entrusted her to run his network of spies in the capital while he fought his rivals on distant battlefields. There was nothing frivolous in either her manner or her appearance; she made no effort to flatter her face with colorful cosmetics or her figure with elegant fabrics. <p></p><p></p>I looked about the room, which reflected the taste of its occupant. The walls were stained deep red and somber yellow. Instead of depicting an image from history or Homer, the impeccably crafted mosaic floor displayed an array of interlocking geometric patterns in muted colors. The furnishings were exquisite but few&#x2014;woolen rugs, bronze lamp holders, and the single backless chair made of ebony inlaid with lapis tiles in which my hostess sat. <p></p><p></p>It was not the reception hall of a queen; those I had seen in Egypt, bright with gold and dripping with ornaments, their dazzle intended to intimidate all who entered. And yet, in fact if not in name, Calpurnia was now the queen of Rome; and Caesar, having defeated every rival, was its king, though for now he preferred the venerable title of dictator, the office our ancestors created so that a strong man could rule the state in times of emergency. But if rumors were true&#x2014;that Caesar intended to make the Senate declare him dictator for life&#x2014;how was he any different from the kings of olden days, before Rome became a proud republic? <p></p><p></p>"Caesar is in danger," Calpurnia said abruptly. She clasped her hands tightly in her lap. Her face was taut. "Great danger. That's why I've called you here." <p></p><p></p>The statement struck me as so peculiar that I laughed out loud, then checked myself when I saw the look on her face. If the most powerful man on earth, the victorious survivor of a brutal civil war that had wreaked havoc across the whole world, was in danger, what could Gordianus the Finder do to protect him? <p></p><p></p>"I'm sure that Caesar can look after himself," I said. "Or if he wants my help, then he can ask me&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"No!" Her voice rose sharply. This was not the dispassionate, coldly calculating Calpurnia I knew but a woman touched by genuine fear. "Caesar doesn't realize the danger. Caesar is . . . distracted." <p></p><p></p>"Distracted?" <p></p><p></p>"He's too busy preparing for his upcoming triumphs." <p></p><p></p>I nodded. There were to be four triumphal processions in the days to come. The first, to celebrate Caesar's conquest of Gaul, would take place three days hence. <p></p><p></p>"Caesar is consumed with the planning and arrangements," she said. "He intends to give the people a series of spectacles such as they've never seen before. Small things fall below his notice. But small things can grow to be great things. They say the Nile crocodile begins life as a creature hardly bigger than my little finger." <p></p><p></p>"Yet it very quickly it grows into a monster that can bite a man in two." <p></p><p></p>"Exactly! That's why I've called you here, Gordianus&#x2014;you have a nose for danger and a taste for finding the truth." She raised a finger. The gesture was so slight I barely noticed it, but an alert slave standing just outside the doorway hurried to her side. <p></p><p></p>"Bring Porsenna," said Calpurnia. <p></p><p></p>The slave departed without a sound. A few moments later, a gray-bearded man entered the room. He wore the yellow costume of an Etruscan haruspex. Over a bright tunic was a pleated cloak fixed at his shoulder with a large clasp of finely wrought bronze. The clasp was in the shape of a sheep's liver marked into numerous sections, with notations in the Etruscan alphabet etched into each section&#x2014;a diviner's chart for locating omens amid the entrails. On his head the haruspex wore a high conical cap, held in place by a strap under his chin. <p></p><p></p>Haruspicy was the Etruscan science of divination. From ancient days, Rome's neighbors to the north worshipped a childgod called Tages, who had snakes for legs. Long ago, Tages appeared to an Etruscan holy man in a freshly plowed field, rising from the dirt and bearing books filled with wisdom. From those books the science of haruspicy was born. <p></p><p></p>Even before Rome was founded, the Etruscans were examining the entrails of sacri.ced animals to predict every aspect of the future, from the outcome of great battles to the next day's weather. They were also adept at interpreting dreams and at finding meaning in various phenomena. Lightning, freakish weather, strange objects fallen from the sky, and the birth of monstrously deformed animals were all attempts by the gods to communicate their will to mankind. <p></p><p></p>Haruspicy had never become a part of Rome's official state religion. To determine the will of the gods, Roman priests consulted the Sibylline Books and Roman augurs observed the flight of birds. (Roman priests sacrificed animals, to be sure, and offered the blood and organs to the gods, but they did not presume to predict the future from this pious activity.) Nevertheless, despite its unofficial status, the ancient Etruscan art of divination persisted. Believers consulted haruspices for guidance in personal and business affairs, and in recent years even the Senate had taken to calling upon a haruspex to read the entrails of a sacrificed beast before beginning the day's debate. <p></p><p></p>One of the charms of haruspicy was the fact that its practitioners used the Etruscan language in their rituals. Nobody spoke Etruscan anymore, not even the Etruscans, and the language is so different from every other language that the sound of it alone conveys an exotic, otherworldly quality. <p></p><p></p>Even so, there were plenty of nonbelievers who scoffed at what they considered outmoded superstitions practiced by charlatans. Cato, leader of the opposition's last stand against Caesar in Africa, once remarked: "When two of these yellowclad buffoons meet in the street, babbling in their incomprehensible tongue, it's a miracle that either can keep a straight face!" Of course, Cato had come to a terrible end, enduring perhaps the most wretched of all the deaths suffered by Caesar's opponents. All Rome would no doubt be reminded of the grisly details during one of the upcoming triumphs. <p></p><p></p>According to my son Meto, who had served with him for many years, Caesar, too, took a dim view of haruspicy. At Pharsalus, all the omens went against Caesar, but he ignored them and went to battle anyway, completely destroying the forces of his chief rival, Pompey. Caesar made a show of observing the old ways of divination, but when the haruspices weighed against him, he had only contempt for them. <p></p><p></p>From everything I knew of her, I would have assumed that Calpurnia placed no more faith in haruspicy than did her husband&#x2014;yet here stood a haruspex in his gaudy yellow garments and peaked hat, looking at me with a smug expression on his face. <p></p><p></p>"This is the one they call the Finder?" he said to Calpurnia. <p></p><p></p>"Yes." <p></p><p></p>Porsenna nodded vigorously, causing his pointed hat to poke the air like a comical weapon in a mime show. "Indeed, this is the very man I saw in my dreams. This is the one who can help you, Calpurnia&#x2014;the only one." <p></p><p></p>She raised an eyebrow. "Before, you said the other fellow was the man to help me&#x2014;and we both know how that turned out." <p></p><p></p>"Yes, but I was right then as well, don't you see? Because that man, despite his misfortune, was the one to lead us to this man. Divination does not always guide us straight to the truth, like the furrow of a plow. Sometimes it meanders, like a stream. No matter. As long as we follow the precepts of Tages, we surely arrive&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"What 'other fellow' are you talking about?" I said. "And what is it you want from me, Calpurnia? When your messenger summoned me, I came here at once. How could I refuse? Before I left for Egypt, you dealt with me honestly and fairly, and I owe you my respect for that, above and beyond your station as the dictator's wife. But I must tell you right now that if you intend to offer me some commission that involves poking into dark corners, uncovering ugly secrets, getting someone killed&#x2014;or getting myself killed!&#x2014;I won't accept it. I'm finished with that sort of thing. I'm too old. I won't have my tranquillity disturbed." <p></p><p></p>"I can pay you handsomely." <p></p><p></p>So she did intend to employ me for some sort of intrigue. I sighed. "Fortunately, I don't need your money. I would advise you to call on my son Eco&#x2014;he does that sort of thing nowadays; and he's younger than I am, faster, stronger, probably twice as clever. Eco is away from Rome at the moment&#x2014;a commission has taken him down to Syracuse&#x2014;but as soon as Eco returns&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"No! It's you we must have, Finder," said Porsenna. "Tages has decreed it." <p></p><p></p>"Just as the god previously decreed that you turn to that 'other fellow' you spoke of&#x2014;the one who met with 'misfortune'? I don't like the sound of that." <p></p><p></p>Calpurnia made a sour face. "You'll at least hear me out, Gordianus." It was a statement, not a question, uttered in a tone to remind me that I was in the presence of the most powerful woman in Rome. <p></p><p></p>I took a deep breath. "What is it you want from me, then?" <p></p><p></p>"Seek the truth. Only that. And why not? It's your nature. It's the thing you were born to do; the gods made you thus. And when you find the truth, I wish you to share it with me&#x2014;and with no one else." <p></p><p></p>"Truth? I thought you had Porsenna to find that for you." <p></p><p></p>She shook her head. "Haruspicy functions at one level. A fellow like you functions at another." <p></p><p></p>"I see. Instead of sifting through entrails, I dig in the dirt." <p></p><p></p>"That's one way of putting it. We each must use whatever skills we possess, do whatever is necessary . . . to save my husband's life." <p></p><p></p>"What is this threat to Caesar?" <p></p><p></p>"I was first alerted by my dreams&#x2014;nightmares so terrible that I sought out Porsenna to interpret them for me. His divinations confirmed my worst fears. Caesar is in immediate and very terrible danger." <p></p><p></p>I sighed. "I'm surprised, Calpurnia. I thought you were not the sort to act on dreams or omens. Others, yes, but not you." <p></p><p></p>"You sound like my husband! I've tried to warn him. He scoffs at my fears." <p></p><p></p>"Have you introduced him to your haruspex?" <p></p><p></p>"No! Caesar knows nothing about Porsenna, nor must he ever know. It would only further arouse his skepticism. But I assure you: Caesar has never been in greater danger." <p></p><p></p>I shook my head. "Surely Caesar has never been in less danger. All his enemies are dead! Pompey, beheaded by Egyptians who wanted to please Caesar. Ahenobarbus, driven to earth and speared like a rabbit by Marc Antony at Pharsalus. Cato, driven to suicide in Africa. The survivors who were pardoned by Caesar, like Cicero, have been reduced to cowering sycophants." <p></p><p></p>"Yet some of them must wish Caesar dead." <p></p><p></p>"Some? Many, I should think. But wishes are not daggers. Have these men the will to act? Caesar thinks not; otherwise, he wouldn't have pardoned them. I trust his judgment. The man has been courting danger all his life, and getting the better of it. Once, in Alexandria, I stood beside him on a quay when a flaming missile from an enemy ship came hurtling straight toward us. I thought that missile was the end of us&#x2014;but Caesar calmly assessed the trajectory, stood his ground, and never flinched. And, sure enough, the missile fell short. Another time, in Alexandria, I watched his ship sink during a battl...</p><h2>Cat Massage: A Whiskers to Tail Guide to Your Cat&#39;s Ultimate Petting Experience</h2><p>Skillfully administered massage provides sublime relaxation and the feeling of intense well-being--for your cat!

Robinson, Judith Tarr, Mercedes Lackey, Larry Dixon, Bill Fawcett, and others. Original.</p><p><strong>Martin H. Greenberg</strong>was honored in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America with the Ellery Queen Award for lifetime achievement in mystery editing. He is also the recipient of two Anthony awards. <em>Mystery Scene</em> magazine called him "the best mystery anthologist since Ellery Queen." He has compiled more than 1,000 anthologies andis the president of TEKNO books.He lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin.In this compelling and entertaining anthology of original pieces, veteran anthologists Resnick and Greenberg offer nearly every short-story angle imaginable on dinosaurs, from prehistorical to post-modern. A few pieces are from the dinosaur point of view, while others are reflective vignettes about the place that our oldest, extinct predecessors hold in the modern imagination. The best stories have themes of dinosaurs physically or symbolically coming back from extinction through replication technology. In Pat Cadigan's contribution, dressing up as your favorite dinosaur in dino clubs has become the latest fashion in a technologically crazy future headed for its own extinction. David Gerrold posits mini-dinos as pets in the suburbia of the future. Once again, they are a fashion trend, an outdated one this time, and Gerrold uses a pet mini-Tyrannosaurus rex as a metaphor for a family breaking apart. Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s similar story, in which mini-saurs become pest-controlling pets in a dystopian, cockroach-infested future, is a poignant comment on a present in which the idea of a past has been all but forgotten.

Just 138 Chinese ideographs suffice to convey the catalogue's wily wisdom. While Swiss Sinologist von Senger requires rather more characters to cover but half of the crafty canons, his text is entertaining enough to interest readers in the promised follow-up. Meanwhile, those impatient for the full story can check Yuan Gao's Lure the Tiger Out of the Mountains (1990). Von Senger ranges widely over time and place to illuminate the 18 precepts he does address, drawing on five millennia of Asian history as well as a broad spectrum of recorded events in the West. In construing the injunction to ``Create Something from Nothing,'' for instance, the author employs examples ranging from the Hapsburgs, Hannibal, and Rommel through Deng Xiaoping. Von Senger's scholarship is not only helpful but essential, since many of the allusive precepts offer counsel not readily apparent to the Occidental mind. Cases in point include: ``Borrow a Corpse for the Soul's Return''; ``Openly Repair the Walkway, Secretly March to Chencang''; ``Loot a Burning House''; and ``Observe the Fire on the Opposite Shore.'' On the other hand, Br'er Rabbit buffs won't miss the point of ``To Catch Something, First Let It Go.'' Nor will fans of Teddy Roosevelt misapprehend ``Hide Your Dagger Behind a Smile.'' Whether von Senger's analyses of an ancient age's guileful gambits can prove helpful (as the promotional material promises) in business, politics, personal affairs, and allied endeavors will strike most observers as a decidedly dubious proposition. At a minimum, though, his interpretive appraisals afford substantial support for Leo Durocher's contention that ``Nice Guys Finish Last.'' -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The author establishes the relevance of Malcolm&#39;s political legacy for the task of rebuilding the movement for Black liberation almost thity years after his assassination.</p><p>There has been a long running debate in the intellectual and religious communities about what is fact and what is supposition surrounding Malcolm X's break with the Nation of Islam and of his formation of Muslim Mosque Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Sales intelligently argues why he considers Malcolm X more than an icon for revolutionary African American youth; he asserts that he is a "multi-faceted thinker and organizer who is worthy of serious study by scholars, activists, and anyone else looking to understand our world today." Throughout the book, he discusses in great detail how Malcolm X's political thinking matured from a simple form of Black nationalism, under the aegis of the Nation of Islam, to a more developed direction of Pan-African internationalism through his own organization, the OAUU. Sales includes many excerpts of Malcolm X's speeches which provide a strong argument for his assertion that Malcolm X spent the remainder of his life in the 1960s trying to internationalize the struggle of African Americans. However, he tends to jump randomly throughout the text addressing Malcolm X the icon, the revolutionary and the man. Perhaps if his points had more of a progressive and gradual direction, it would make for more enjoyable reading. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Moon Blue Ridge &amp; Smoky Mountains (Moon Handbooks)</h2><p>Travel writer Jason Frye offers his firsthand experience and advice on the Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountains&#x2014;including North Carolina High Country, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the Cherokee Indian Reservation.

Carol Shields, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1995 for <i>The Stone Diaries</i>, has already proved herself a writer who can convey large truths with an economical amount of material, which makes her an excellent choice as Austen's biographer. Shields's brief but cogent text makes persuasive connections between Austen's novels and her life (the plethora of unsatisfactory mothers, for example, and the obvious sympathy for women barred from marriage by poverty and from careers by social custom), but she never forgets that fiction expresses first and foremost an artist's response to the world around her, not actual personal history. In fact, Shields argues, it may well have been Austen's sense that the novels she loved to read didn't provide a very accurate picture of the society she knew that fired her own work. Her merciless portraits of the economic underpinnings of marriage and family relations are in many ways more "realistic" than male writers' dramas of battle or females' fantasies of romantic bliss. As for her life's lack of incident, its one major disruption--her parents' move to Bath--prompted a nine-year silence from their formerly prolific daughter. Shields gleans as much as she can from Austen's letters, while remembering that they too gave voice to a persona, not the whole truth, in order to delineate a quirky, sometimes cranky, sometimes catty woman who was by no means the perfect maiden lady her surviving relatives sought to immortalize. An Austen biography will never be as much fun as an Austen novel, but Shields does a remarkably entertaining job of discerning the links between the two. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Carol Diggory-Shields is the author of many works for children including the poetry books<em>Lunch Money</em>, <em>Almost Late to School, and</em><em>After the Bell Rings</em>.

We have long been schooled in the myth of the Egyptian ruler. In his new book Michel Chauveau brings us a picture of her firmly based in reality. </p><p>Cleopatra VII reigned in Egypt between 51 and 30 B.C.E. Her primary goal as a ruler was to restore over the eastern Mediterranean the supremacy of the Lagides, the dynasty of Macedonian origin of which she herself was a descendant. We know the queen best from Greek and Latin sources, though these must be used with caution because of their bias. Understandably enough, they reflect not only matters of interest to Romans, but also the propaganda that Octavian used against the queen during his struggles with Mark Antony. Chauveau combines his knowledge of Egyptian sources with judicious use of classical materials to produce an authoritative biography of Cleopatra, the woman and queen, seen in the light of the turbulent era in which she lived.</p></p><p><p>Michel Chauveau is a former member of the Institut Fran�ais d'Arch�ologie Orientale in Cairo, and is currently director of studies at L'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris. He is the author of Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra: History and Society under the Ptolemies, also from Cornell. David Lorton, an Egyptologist, lives in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>"Cleopatra: Beyond the Myth might better have been titled Stripped of Myth, for that is what Chauveau attempts in this attractive and useful little book, leading us through the thorny world negotiated by Cleopatra: a distillation of the short life of a very energetic, ambitious, and&#x2015;staying with fact&#x2015;seductive woman, who bore children by both Caesar and Antony, and who, in a certain sense, conjured her own empire out of nothing. The empire proved ephemeral, but Cleopatra lives on in myth, and here, in the surviving facts."</p> (John Mosher, History: Reviews of New Books)<br><br><p>"Hoping to rescue the Egyptian queen from 'clich�s that have been spread by... a complaisant literature,' not to mention by Elizabeth Taylor vehicles, Chauveau offers Cleopatra: Beyond the Myth. In this concise biography based on the few surviving Greek, Latin and Egyptian texts that mention her, Chauveau shows how the lack of sources (as well as Cleopatra's own attempts to mythologize her reign) has allowed romantic legends to flourish."</p> (Publishers Weekly, April 1, 2002)<br><br><p>"Michel Chauveau... attempts to 'exorcise the myth' and present the 'facts' of Cleopatra's life and death."</p> (Mary Beard, London Review of Books, 20 March 2003)<br><br><p>"Cleopatra succeeds in conveying the events of Cleopatra's life as well as the circumstances that surrounded those events.... what a different portrait of Cleopatra emerges when we allow ourselves only the certainties of her life (as far as they can be established and permit ourselves to leave blanks where no evidence exists. What remains is enough, however, to tell us that for the Egyptians, as C. puts it, Cleopatra was 'the last and the greatest of their queens.'."</p> (Prudence Jones, Rutgers University, Bryn Mawr Classical Review, May 2002)<br><br><p>"This small book is a good read by a good scholar, and the translation reads so well that one frequently forgets the text was originally French. There is plenty here for the nonspecialist in Graeco-Roman Egypt."</p></p><h2>Measure, Integration, and Probability</h2><p>The aim of the book is to present in one volume the modern theory of measure and integration and a measure-theoretic treatment of probability theory.

Hannah is shocked to learn that the newly titled earl is none other than Dougald Pippard, the man she loved and ran away from nine years before. Dougald isn't the slightest bit surprised to see Hannah, for her arrival at Raeburn Castle is the result of a carefully planned scheme to bring her back into his life. Furthermore, he has the power to compel her to remain in Lancashire, for he can give Hannah something she yearns for--a meeting with her deceased father's parents.</p><p> While Hannah and Dougald are engaged in a battle of wits and wills, something wicked is afoot at the Castle. The prior two earls were killed in accidents shortly after coming into the title, and when Dougald is shot at and then attacked by thugs, it's clear that he's next on someone's hit list. Whether Hannah and Dougald will arrive at a mutually agreeable truce is debatable, but before the two can live happily ever after they must first discover the identity of the mysterious villain.</p><p> This latest in Christina Dodd's Governess series has delightfully Gothic touches with the heroine arriving at a forbidding castle on a stormy night, a dark, brooding hero, and danger threatening the two. In typical Dodd fashion, however, the Gothic elements are offset by the warmth and humor in the wonderfully interesting cast of secondary characters and plenty of romantic tension between Hannah and her earl.<i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p><b>Join Christina Dodd's FREE mailing list</b> for book sales, book news, and entertainment brought right to your inbox!

Boxed elements include Supervising in the Real World, The Supervisor in Action, Did You Know? and Technology in Action. These boxes are meant to provide additional information that may be of special interest to supervisors. Training newly promoted supervisors; on-boarding, induction, and off-boarding; performance appraisal questions; brainstorming; managing mobile phone use in the workplace; and reducing employee resistance to change are just some of the topics covered. Each chapter also includes two new case studies that give students the opportunity to look at real-world situations and apply principles and concepts discussed in the chapter. These case studies can be discussed in a classroom or training room setting, or addressed by students on an individual basis or within student teams. The robust instructor resource package that accompanies this textbook includes chapter exams, PowerPoint� presentations, and an Instructor Manual with answer keys as well as additional discussion topics and scaffolding for the textbook case studies.

Holocaust survivor Flory A. Van Beek faced this terrible choice, and in this poignant testament of hope she takes us on her personal journey into one of history's darkest hours.</p><p>Only a teenage girl when the Nazis invaded her neutral homeland of Holland, Flory watched the only life she had ever known disappear. Tearfully leaving her family, Flory tried to escape on the infamous SS <em>Simon Bolivar</em> passenger ship with Felix, the young Jewish man from Germany who would later become her husband. Their voyage brought not safety but more peril as their ship was blown up by Nazi planted mines, one of the first passenger ships destroyed by the Germans during World War II, sending nearly all of its passengers to a watery end. Miraculously, both Flory and Felix survived.</p><p>After recovering from their injuries in England, they returned to their homeland, overjoyed to be reunited with their families yet shocked to discover their beloved Holland a much-changed place. As the Nazi grip tightened, they were forced into hiding. Sheltered by compassionate strangers in confined quarters, cut off from the outside world and their relatives, they faced hunger and the stress of daily life shadowed by the ever-present threat of certain death. Yet they also discovered, with the remarkable and brave families who sacrificed their own safety to help keep Flory and Felix alive, a set of friends that remain as close as family to this day.</p><p>A tribute to family, faith, and the power of good in the face of disparate evil, this gripping account captures the terror of the Holocaust, the courage of those who risked their lives to protect their fellow compatriots, and the faith of those who, against all odds, managed to survive. </p></p><p><p>Flory A. Van Beek came to America in 1948 carrying a suitcase full of papers and photographs that she had buried while in hiding during the Holocaust. This material is now one of the largest collections from the Netherlands housed in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Flory and her husband, Felix, live in Newport Beach, California.</p>FLORY is the gripping, extraordinary, and surprisingly uplifting story of Flory Van Beek and her miraculous survival of the Holocaust. Complemented by an outstanding performance by narrator Kirsten Potter, the book tells the harrowing story of Flory and her eventual husband Felix&#39;s flight from Holland to Argentina, and their return to Holland after German mines sank their ship and severely injured them. Eventually, Flory and Felix were forced into hiding. Potter conveys the stress the Van Beeks felt and highlights the remarkable faith and strength of the many other people who also fought to stay alive. Potter also demonstrates that authenticity and emotion can outweigh a somewhat simplistic writing style, especially during the scene in which Van Beek explains how she eventually received the letter her mother wrote on the train to Auschwitz.

He&#39;s currently an animator at Pixar and has also worked for Cartoon Network, Disney, and Nickelodeon. Scott lives with his loving family in Northern California.Grade 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;One of a series of illustrated chapter books coming on the heels of Morse's graphic novel (Scholastic, 2008), this title continues the adventures of Jo Jo Wigman and the superpowered pickle that lives in a secret government base underneath her bedroom. This particular adventure focuses on Jo Jo's agricultural class project and the plant growth serum she finds in the Magic Pickle's lab. The spot illustrations are lively, with crackling energy dots and a constant sense of action and movement. The prose is occasionally interrupted by short bursts of story told in a pure comic-book format before returning to text at the start of a new chapter. These segments don't seem to add anything that the illustrations don't already provide, but they do give the audience one more guided way to read and participate in the action. While the story contains a minor lesson about personal responsibility, the main focus seems to be the emphatic prose, which is littered with sound effects and visual punch to increase the action quotient and the ease of reading. The comic segments, typography sound effects, and the like are cues with which struggling readers can propel themselves along.&#x2014;<i>Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She can see it coming. Then she&#x2019;s not quite sure.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>But the wind sweeps over the path of trembling grass. It slithers, climbs up the bank, and chafes the hedge that ends at the beach in a cross shape. Then it falls silent, crouching like a wild animal, watching the street. Gathering momentum, it swoops down onto the asphalt, skips over the manicured hydrangeas, and picks up strength.</p><p>She watches, intrigued, as it advances. It&#x2019;s coming closer now, brushing against the painted wooden houses, very close. It glides up the old maple tree that fills her window and coils itself snakelike around the trunk, transforming the branches into long, twitching fingers.</p><p>It taps at her window. It presses up against the glass. It whistles and calls to her as the rattling branches beat against the panes.</p><p>Julia is happy. She tugs impatiently at the lock on the frame and forces the window open. Leaning out, she allows the vagabond wind to sweep in and fill her entire being, breathes in deep lungfuls of its sharp air. She closes her eyes. She recognizes that salty, tarry smell. This Connecticut wind is strangely similar to the wind of her Buenos Aires childhood. It&#x2019;s not as intense, perhaps; lighter, more delicate. Or perhaps not. She knows from experience that memory can&#x2019;t be relied on to capture the true essence of things. The present often seems less vibrant than our recollections of the past.</p><p>Even so, Julia couldn&#x2019;t be happier.</p><p>She smiles. She likes the restraint of her surroundings: the neatly clipped shrubs in the gardens across the way, the carefully aligned elms along the avenue that runs perpendicular to the beach, the hedge and the grass that frame the fine sand like a rampart stretching parallel to the waves, and the horizon like a straight line drawn from one end to the other.</p><p>It suits her, this symmetry. She has finished putting her life in order. She is in her rightful place, living the destiny she has chosen for herself, with the man she has always loved. Julia feels fulfilled.</p><p>She looks up at the azure sky above her maple tree. Happiness is blue. Blue horizon, blue water.</p><p>A Mark Rothko painting, she thinks, forming a picture frame in the air with her fingers.</p><p>She&#x2019;d like to hang that painting just in front of her face to remind herself that happiness is right there, within arm&#x2019;s reach.</p><p>Funny. This idea that happiness is blue: it&#x2019;s as if she&#x2019;s had this thought before.</p><p>All of a sudden the wind sets up a high-pitched whistling and rushes in through the window. Maple twigs catch at Julia&#x2019;s dress and scratch her skin. The sky has gone dark. Julia shivers. The air smells humid. The next moment a flash of lightning rips her painting from top to bottom. The light is blinding. It hurts, as if a razor had slit her retina.</p><p>A sharp cracking sound shatters the silence. The tree across the road has been split in two. Its heart is blown open, scorched, but the tree has not caught fire. One of the severed branches dangles dangerously close to the power lines along the avenue.</p><p>Julia ducks her head back in, pulls the window shut, and turns around, trembling. She scans the room, ready to face whatever might be coming. But everything is in order, each item sitting silently in its assigned place. Still, her eyes continue flicking back and forth, lingering on dark corners, decoding shadows.</p><p>Seized by an irrational feeling of panic, she gathers up the dirty clothes piled in the hamper and hurries downstairs to the basement laundry room. She arrives panting. <i>Such a fright, for no reason!</i> She shrugs her shoulders.</p><p>And then she feels the tremors begin. They always start the same way: a tingling in her heels, getting sharper as it travels up her calves, intensifying as it reaches her knees.</p><p>Julia knows she has only a few minutes before she passes out. She climbs the laundry room steps on all fours and crawls across the kitchen and into the living room. She needs to get into a corner of the room and prop herself up before it&#x2019;s too late. She wedges herself into the corner, sits up straight, legs stretched out in front of her for balance. One brief moment to congratulate herself for reacting in time, and then her world turns upside down. Her inner eye has taken over.</p><p>She feels herself slipping away. Her gaze clouds over; her eyes are choked with a thick white mist, and her mind shifts to another place. Julia floats into nothingness, beyond time and space. She has lost control of her body. She has abandoned it, like a lost glove, between two walls of her living room.</p><p>She is familiar with this journey, though she can never predict how long it will last or where it will take her.</p><p>Julia&#x2019;s not scared anymore. She knows she won&#x2019;t die; she knows she won&#x2019;t suffocate in the white substance enveloping her. She has the gift; she has received instruction; she is part of a lineage. All of her energy is being channeled into the connection that is about to take place. Her inner eye will graft itself onto someone else&#x2019;s vision&#x2014;someone completely unknown to her.</p><p>Suddenly Julia finds herself in a dimly lit room, looking through a half-open door. She can see a young woman with her back turned illuminated in the glare of a neon light. The woman is wearing a skin-tight black dress down to her ankles. Her black hair is pulled back into a perfect chignon, as round and shiny as a pebble. She is carefully applying her makeup, her graceful neck bent forward to bring her face closer to the mirror covering the wall.</p><p>The eyes through which Julia is looking trace the young woman&#x2019;s slim figure from the nape of her neck to her heels, lingering on the hollow of her back. Aware she is being watched, the woman turns around. She has Oriental eyes and full red lips. They part in a distant smile, revealing perfect teeth.</p><p>Julia&#x2019;s source is sitting on the edge of a bed. A man. She glimpses his strong knees, realizes he is naked. Her peripheral vision takes in the drawn curtains, the mussed sheets, a chest of drawers behind the half-open door, articles of clothing thrown carelessly over a chair.</p><p>The man gets up and walks toward the young woman. Julia sees a small, impersonal bathroom. She recognizes the logo of a large American hotel chain on the damp towels lying on the floor.</p><p>The young woman holds out a hand in a gesture of affection and finds herself being swept up into a passionate embrace from which she hastily disengages herself, laughing. She spins around, throwing one last look at herself in the mirror, picks up her handbag from beside the washbasin, and walks quickly out of the room, perched confidently on her high heels. The door clicks shut behind her.</p><p>Julia searches in the shadows for a long moment, then her field of vision shifts to the left. It travels up the bed and comes to rest on a mobile phone that is buzzing insistently, like a fly on its back. The man ignores it. He lies down and closes his eyes. Julia remains trapped in the dark for some time, helpless, unable to enter the thoughts or dreams of the person she&#x2019;s been twinned with.</p><p>And then the connection breaks. Julia feels herself being propelled to the surface. She breaks free from the darkness and travels through the milky white haze. Light restores the shapes of objects, signaling the gradual return of her sight. Slowly things come into focus. Her hands are still on her knees; her body is still wedged into the corner. Only her head has moved. It hangs heavily in front of her. The nape of her neck is sore, the way it always is after one of her journeys.</p><p>She rubs the back of her neck hard. Then she begins the set of stretches she learned from her grandmother. She circles her head slowly, from left to right and back again, until the stiffness eases. The inside of her neck crunches like crumpled paper. This journey was particularly long. She folds her legs into a lotus position and stretches her back, sticking her neck out like a turtle. Julia breathes slowly, centers herself. She regains control of her body by repeating the movements that have been part of her return ritual since childhood.</p><p>Little by little she becomes aware of the noises coming from the street. Looking out the window, she sees a team of uniformed men busy clearing away the remains of the dead tree. All signs of the storm have vanished and the sky has cleared. Only then does it occur to her to glance at her watch. It&#x2019;s noon. She hasn&#x2019;t had breakfast yet. She hasn&#x2019;t even started work. Luckily Theo&#x2019;s gotten into the habit of coming home late from the office. This gives her a few extra hours to finish her translations and get them to the client on time.</p><p>Ever self-disciplined, she prepares a large bowl of yogurt, almonds, and dried fruit so she can eat while reading through the pages. The text is beautiful. She has no problem finding the right words to transpose thoughts from one language to another. But she finds it harder to capture the harmony of sounds, their rhythm, their cadence. The task of re-creating the music of one language in another is more like art than anything else. It is what she finds most challenging. She plunges into her work with enthusiasm.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Julia jumps when she hears the front door open and realizes it&#x2019;s already 7:30 P.M. She hastily closes her laptop and smooths out the creases in her red dress. She glances in the mirror on the landing before going downstairs, relieved to find she looks nice. No traces of her journey, no need for explanations.</p><p>Theo is in the kitchen sorting through the mail. He has emptied his pockets and placed his keys on the countertop. He pauses when he sees Julia. Smiling, he takes her in his arms and spins her around. Then he kisses her on the forehead, as if to indicate that playtime is over.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving, my love,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m exhausted.&#x201d;</p><p>Julia&#x2019;s face clouds over. She pulls away, disappointed. She stares at Theo&#x2019;s shirt, at his hands. Lost in thought, she slowly opens the refrigerator.</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow&#x2019;s Friday,&#x201d; she says in a level tone. &#x201c;Maybe you could take the day off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I tell you? They&#x2019;ve changed the rules. No more working longer during the week and taking Fridays off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re still getting up really early. Earlier and earlier, in fact. Wait, let me do the math.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t work that way anymore, sweetheart. Anyway, I&#x2019;m putting in overtime because it looks like I might be getting a promotion.&#x201d;</p><p>Julia gives him a blank look.</p><p>Theo slips in front of her and pushes the refrigerator door shut. &#x201c;You still haven&#x2019;t learned to close doors, Julia my love,&#x201d; he says with a hint of irritation.</p><p>He walks out of the kitchen and goes upstairs. Julia follows mechanically. She wants to tell him about the lightning and the tree. But before she can catch up with him, he&#x2019;s gone into the bathroom and double-locked the door.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.</p><p>THE FIRST JOURNEY</p><p>Austral Summer</p><p>1962</p><p>She must have been five years old the first time it happened. She was living in Colonia del Sacramento, in Uruguay, in an old house behind the port, overlooking the estuary. She was playing in a dusty courtyard, away from the older children, who had devised a game of jumping off a low wall into the garden next door and terrorizing the neighbor&#x2019;s old dog.</p><p>Julia knew she was poor. Not because she lacked anything but because her mother complained about it. The word &#x201c;poor&#x201d; meant nothing to Julia. Oddly enough, she associated it with her carefree existence, far removed from adult preoccupations. But she also understood that it was the reason why her father had gone away and left them. And she missed him. Her mother would point to the R�o de la Plata* and explain that he had gone to look for work over there in Argentina, on the other side of the water.</p><p>&#x201c;The river of silver, the river of silver&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Julia would say to herself over and over, like the words of a magic spell. She would stand at the railing for hours on end, staring down at the port of Colonia and the expanse of gray water flecked with silver that stretched as far as she could see. What more could there possibly be on the other side? She didn&#x2019;t understand.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; she would ask, &#x201c;why has Dad gone away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To get money for us, of course!&#x201d;</p><p>Julia would stare with fascination at the platinum glint of the water below her. Turning to her mother, she would insist: &#x201c;But, Mom, what about all the silver in the river? We don&#x2019;t need any more!&#x201d;</p><p>Her exasperated mother would roll her eyes and reply: &#x201c;�Nena! �El R�o de la Plata no es ni un r�o, ni es de plata!&#x201d;*</p><p>Her twin brothers were only too delighted to hear their mother scolding Julia. They were nearly two years older and liked to treat her as a punching bag. They taunted her mercilessly, shoved her around, and tripped her up. Anna, her older sister, would rush to her rescue, gathering her up and chasing the twins away with a slap. &#x201c;Daddy will be home soon, Julia. Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; she would whisper in her ear.</p><p>Anna was the only one who could console Julia, because she too was desperately impatient for their father to return. For that reason, and because her mother was so distant and so strict with her, Julia showered all the love she was storing up for her father on her older sister. She would have liked to be included in the twins&#x2019; games but she was too scared of them; they were such daredevils. Besides, they had taught themselves to swim and spent most of their time in the river, where Julia couldn&#x2019;t follow them.</p><p>On the afternoon of her first mysterious journey, Julia was in the backyard, sitting on the kitchen steps. She was playing by herself, drawing shapes in the dirt with her finger and filling an old oil canister with pebbles. At that time of day, the children had usually finished their lunch. It was Anna&#x2019;s job to reheat the meal their mother had made at dawn before leaving for work. But on that particular day she had told Anna to wait: she would bring some groceries back from town.</p><p>The sun was beating down.

The accurate, authoritative text will provide information that is new to all but the exceptionally well-informed aviation buff and nonspecialist historian."</i><br> --Choice</b> </p><p> For a world coming out of economic depression in the 1930s, the Pan American Airways Clipper "flying boats" symbolized elegance and luxury, adventure and romance. Illustrated with rare period photographs, vintage travel posters, magazine ads and colorful company brochures, this fascinating book covers every aspect of the fabulous era of Pan American's graceful clippers. </p><p> Like their maritime namesakes, the Clippers used the oceans to form a vast global network of travel routes. Pan Am founder Juan Trippe was a visionary who saw the importance of international travel to a changing world. His Clippers would play a key role in the evolution of transoceanic flight, setting time and distance records over the Atlantic and Pacific, providing airmail delivery between continents and eventually serving the Allies as troop and cargo transports during World War II. </p><p> Pan Am Clippers permanently changed the world's concept of time and space by dramatically reducing travel time and opening up international air travel to the general public. This fascinating, informative and richly illustrated book brings back another time and way of life. </p></p><p><p><b>James Trautman</b> is a regular contributor to North American magazines, newspapers and television. He has worked on projects to uncover the wreckage of one of the Pan Am Clippers lost in World War II. He lives in southern Ontario.</p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> One may challenge the above quote [not included in this excerpt], but the early years of aviation in the 1920s would fit nicely into The Great Gatsby and its old wealth mixing with the new self-made millionaires of the Roaring Twenties. Much of this new wealth had been made through war production during World War I. World War II would alter civilian aviation and create a climate for the expansion of cheaper air travel for the masses. But that was in the future, and in the 1920s and 1930s, international air travel would be for the more elite. The early days of civilian air travel had only one type of passenger class: first class. </p><p> Juan Trippe would take over the fledgling Pan American Airways and turn it into a worldwide airline. His family was old wealth, having made their money in the great Clipper sailing ships of the 1800s. </p><p> Another key figure in the formative years of aviation and Pan American Airways was Harry Guggenheim, who would become Charles Lindbergh's mentor. The two met prior to Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic to Paris. Guggenheim told Lindbergh they would get together once he returned from his epic venture. Whether he believed that Lindbergh would make it back or not is open to debate. The Guggenheim family made their wealth in mining and reinvested in the future of the United States by establishing many foundations, including the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. This foundation would be responsible for the development of blind instrument flying, the establishment of the Safe Aircraft Competition and, most importantly, the establishment of major centers of aeronautical engineering throughout the United States. </p><p> Harry Guggenheim was true to his word, and Lindbergh was introduced to the wealthy and connected of the United States at parties in the Hamptons, people like Dwight Morrow and Thomas Lamont of the J. P. Morgan bank, Juan Trippe, Orville Wright, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Theodore Roosevelt Jr., and Herbert Hoover. The groups that met at the parties were the foundation that would push the development of American aviation, including the concept of passenger travel. Dwight Morrow would eventually become Lindbergh's father-in-law, and Harry Guggenheim would appoint Lindbergh as a consultant to the Guggenheim Aeronautical Fund at a salary of $25,000 per year. </p><p> Juan Trippe would operate Pan American Airways until his retirement in 1968, experiencing years that would bring glory and almost total defeat. At a Pan American Airways board meeting on March 14, 1939, Trippe would lose most of his power. The <i>China Clipper</i> routes were in the red and the board was not sold on the Atlantic routes to Europe. Eventually, Trippe would take back his power, but the routes would continue to be money losers. At some times, more flights were cancelled due to inclement weather than were flying. </p><p> The arrival of World War II and the end of the Golden Age of Flying Boats may have been a blessing to Pan American Airways. </p></p><h2>The Creative Imagination: Enlightenment to Romanticism</h2><p>In a work of astonishing intellectual range, James Engell traces the evolution of the creative imagination, from its emergence in British empirical thought through its flowering in Romantic art and literature. The notion of a creative imagination, Engell shows, was the most powerful and important development of the eighteenth century. It grew simultaneously in literature, criticism, philosophy, psychology, religion, and science, attracting such diverse minds as Hobbes, Addison, Gerard, Goethe, Kant, and Coleridge. Indeed, rather than discussing merely the abstract notion of the imagination, Engell examines the community of thinkers, especially in England and Germany, who joined to pursue and develop what became the most fascinating and suggestive concept of modern Western thought. For as the imagination became the dominant subject of literature, its meanings multiplied. Finally it came to be seen as the crown of artistic creation and as the mediator in the ongoing dialectic between matter and spirit, materialism and transcendentalism.</p><p><b>James Engell</b>, Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Harvard, is the author of <i>The Creative Imagination</i>, editor and contributor to <i>Johnson and His Age</i>, and coeditor (with David Perkins) of <i>Teaching Literature: What is Needed Now</i>, all published by Harvard University Press. He is also coeditor of the Bollingen edition of the <i>Biographia Literaria</i> for the <i>Collected Works</i> of Coleridge.</p><h2>The World Must Know: The History of the Holocaust As Told in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</h2><p>Coinciding with the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in April, this volume commemorates the victims of the Holocaust, using photographs of the museum&#39;s artifacts to document the human stories.</p><p>Opened in April 1993, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., summons all who enter its portals to rise to an important and extraordinary challenge: to remember and immortalize the 6 million Jews and millions of other Nazi victims of World War II - Gypsies, Poles, homosexuals, the handicapped, Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, political and religious dissidents, Soviet prisoners of war - who were murdered in the most horrifying event of our time: the Holocaust. The World Must Know depicts the evolution of the Holocaust comprehensively, as it is presented in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum - the living memorial to the victims of the Holocaust that tells a story the world must know in the most moving and powerful visual and verbal way. Drawing on the museum&#39;s artifacts and its extensive eyewitness testimony collection, the second largest in the world, and including over 200 photographic images from the museum&#39;s collections, The World Must Know details the four major historical participants: the perpetrator, the bystander, the rescuer, and, above all, the victim. The World Must Know journeys back to a time when Jewish culture thrived in Europe, to family Shabbat dinners and joyous Passover celebrations where the lighting of the candles was done before unshuttered windows, and proceeds to that point when the most unspeakable evil in history began, and then bears witness to the most horrifying shattering of innocent lives. Starting with the rise of nazism, The World Must Know reveals the human stories of the Holocaust, documenting the range of psychological extremes from the evil of the Nazi doctors whostaffed the death camps and determined &#34;who shall live and who shall die&#34;, to the nobility of ordinary citizens, like those in the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France, who risked their own lives by offering their homes as havens to refugee Jews, to the horror of entire families as they received sudden orders to pack up only what they could carry, leave their homes, and report to a train station for &#34;resettlement in the East&#34;, a euphemism for deportation to Auschwitz, Treblinka, Sobibor, and other death or concentration camps. The powerful and evocative images in The World Must Know tell the stories of hope and death - the grim reality of the ghettos, the mass murders of the mobile killing units, the concentration camps, and the death camps, as well as the brave and heart-wrenching stories of resistance and rescue, through which we see the human necessity for - and the ultimate power of - personal choice. More than a catalogue of the museum&#39;s exhibit, The World Must Know is a study and exploration of the Holocaust that fulfills the commandment from those who perished, which seared the souls of those who survived: Remember. Do not let the world forget. This is a significant contribution to our understanding of the history of the Holocaust that will not only memorialize the past by educating the generations that follow but also transform the future by sensitizing those who will shape it. That is the challenge to, and the responsibility of, all survivors everywhere.<p><b>Michael Berenbaum </b> has served as president of Steven Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, as deputy director of the President's Commission on the Holocaust, and as project director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

This exciting and original book is the first to consider the two artists together, examining the powerful portraits they created during the vibrant and tumultuous era bookended by the Stonewall riots and the AIDS crisis. Several important bodies of work are featured, including Warhol&#x2019;s <i>Ladies and Gentlemen </i>series of drag queen portraits and his collaboration with Christopher Makos on <i>Altered Image</i>, in which Warhol was photographed in makeup and wigs, and Mapplethorpe&#x2019;s photographs of Patti Smith and of female body builder Lisa Lyon.

Some of the stories are silly (Super Pets, Bizarro Legionnaires, Legionnaire babies, the revolt of the girl Legionnaires), but there's also Computo, the mad machine who killed a Legionnaire; the Legion of Super Outlaws (including Duplicate Boy); Lightning Lad vs. the Super Moby-Dick of Space; the Legion civil war; the trial of Star Boy; and the Luck Lords. New villains were Starfinger, Dr. Regulus, and the warfaring Khunds, and new members included Timber Wolf, Karate Kid, Ferro Lad, and Princess Projectra. The art is mostly by John Forte or Superman legend Curt Swan, and the writing by Jerry Siegel or Edmond Hamilton, until issue 346, when 13-year-old wunderkind Jim Shooter ushered in the writing (and storyboarding, the large-panel style of which is noticeably different from the norm) that would carry the Legion to new heights. Also included are two Superboy stories from the same era involving peripheral Legionnaries: Insect Queen and Evolvo Lad. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Another wonderful collection from Random House</p><h2>The Phoenix Transformed: Book Three of the Enduring Flame</h2><p><br><p>In the Enduring Flame trilogy, Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory have given readers a new view of the complex and fascinating world they originally created for the Obsidian Trilogy.&nbsp; Jumping one thousand years in time, Lackey and Mallory have told the compelling story of Harrier Gillain, the first Knight-Mage in a thousand years; Tiercel Rolfort, the first High Mage in hundreds of years; and Shaiara, the young leader of a desert tribe who takes both boys under her wing but has a special affection for Harrier.&nbsp;<br><br>These three young people are their world&#x2019;s main defense against the evil called up by the rogue Wild Mage, Bisochim.

But what many people don&#39;t know is that she&#39;s an avid golfer who regularly plays on the celebrity pro-am circuit. In fact, she is one of the most sought-after players worldwide, and for over twenty years has partnered with many of the world&#39;s best golfers from the PGA and LPGA tours. When playing side by side with these top golfers, Cheryl feels like the &#39;ultimate hacker in heaven.&#39; Golf has become her passion.</p><p><b>Cheryl Ladd</b> is a well-known television actress whose career began on the hit show <i>Charlie&#x2019;s Angels</i>. She is currently guest-starring on NBC&#x2019;s hit TV drama, <i>Las Vegas</i>. Her first book, a children&#x2019;s book, was published in 1996. Cheryl Ladd is married and lives in Los Angeles.Through recollections of her many moments being the only woman in the male celebrity-dominated pro-am (professional-amateur) world, Ladd&#x2014;clearly and proudly addressing women readers&#x2014;explains how she turned being a "token chick" into an advantage, a learning experience and a cause for celebration. In 18 short chapters with titles like "BBB: Boys Behaving Badly," and "Golf + PMS = The Pre-Menstrual Swing," Ladd uses her experiences to provide valuable, practical technical tips ("So, how can we make our breasts work for us in our golf swing?") and does so without condescending to those who may not know a lot about the game. Sure, Ladd's <i>Charlie's Angels </i>fame has afforded her the opportunity to play with some big names, and she fills the book with tales of, conversations with, anecdotes about, photos of and tips from people she's played with and learned from including Arnold Palmer and Annika Sorenstam. But she doesn't shy away from describing some embarrassing moments, such as getting hit by golf balls and striking a bird on the course. Chapters end with a page of Token Tips, which are methodological yet still written in Ladd's easy, conversational language. Photos. <i>Agent, Daniel Strone at Trident Media Group.

Whether as customers, employees, or citizens, people demand more engagement with providers of goods and services, with their employers, and with their governments. People today are highly connected and networked, sharing their experiences of using products and services. They want to help design the value of the products and services they use; they want an ongoing conversation with the organizations they do business with and with each other; and they want their voices heard. Yet, in spite of their best efforts, many organizations are locked into a firm-centric paradigm of value and its creation. They fail to engage people in generating better products and services that the organization can deliver. Technology gives innovators and marketers more and more options in designing and delivering products and services, yet they struggle to connect with what people value, and this further frustrates people. As a result, satisfaction ratings are declining or flat across many industries, and loyalty is increasingly a thing of the past.<br> <br>During 2000 to 2004, Venkat Ramaswamy (together with C. K. Prahalad) wrote a series of articles on the implications for business and society of the more connected and empowered customer. They detailed the shifting of competencies toward a network of customer communities and global talent outside the firm on one hand, and the emergence of global resource networks of firms on the other. The authors suggested that customer experience is central to enterprise value creation, innovation, strategy, and executive leadership.1 These broad changes in business and society, they argued, called for <i>co-creation</i>&#x2014;the practice of developing systems, products, or services through collaboration with customers, managers, employees, and other company stakeholders. Their book, <i>The Future of Competition</i> (Harvard Business School Press, 2004), offered a series of compelling examples showing that value is being increasingly created jointly by the firm and the customer, rather than created entirely inside the firm. The authors held that customers seek the freedom of choice to interact with firms through a range of experiences. Customers want to define choices in a manner that reflects their view of value, and they want to interact and transact in their preferred language and style. <i>The Future of Competition</i> provided a new frame of reference for jointly creating value through experiences.2 Just three years after its publication, a number of businesses had capitalized on opportunities anticipated by the book&#x2014;whether start-ups such as Crushpad, which made winemaking a more democratic process using Web 2.0 technologies, or established businesses such as Brother, which breathed new life into a century-old product, the sewing machine, by networking the product and nurturing active user communities.<br> <br>In many ways <i>The Future of Competition</i> portrayed the digital and consumer universe we know today. It also commenced an ongoing journey for Venkat Ramaswamy. In 2005 Francis Gouillart joined the journey, and the authors started developing a transformational framework for co-creation. Through their interactions with thousands of managers globally who had begun experimenting with co-creation, they discovered that enterprises were building platforms that engaged not only the firm and its customers, but also the entire network of suppliers, partners, and employees in a continuous development of new experiences with individuals. In some cases, they found that organizations had gone further in extending their resource base through practices such as crowdsourcing, mass collaboration, and open innovation. In other cases, they were tapping into user communities and social networking among customers. Some organizations had also begun allowing their customers to personalize products. Others were engaging suppliers in new forms of vendor relationships. Still others had developed new ways of interacting with their employees and were able to mobilize their workforce to unheard-of levels of performance through co-creation. In all these cases, companies were succeeding by paying attention to how they <i>engaged</i> people. Managers had to make the fundamental shift to go beyond their conventional goods-services mind-set to an <i>experience mind-set</i>&#x2014;defining value based on human experiences rather than features and processes, whether downstream or upstream, in the value chain. They further observed that success lies in using people&#x2019;s engagement experiences to generate insights to improve the nature of <i>interactions</i> as a result, including inside the enterprise. Interactions among people inside and outside the firm became the connective tissue where new insights, learning, and innovation were generated.<br> <br>As shown in <b>Figure 1-1,</b> the activity chain of the enterprise no longer solely creates value, nor is its value proposition unilaterally defined by the organization. The activity chain remains key in creating goods and services, but customers, suppliers, partners, and employees are no longer limiting their experience to just &#x201c;receiving&#x201d; what is being offered by the enterprise&#x2019;s activity chain. They increasingly want to insert themselves into that activity chain, and also open up to the possibility of enhancing value in their own activities. In other words, people want to be personally engaged in co-creating value through human experiences. In doing so, the traditional distinction between production and consumption gets blurred.<br> <br><b>Figure 1-1: Becoming a Co-Creative Enterprise</b><br> <br><br> <br>Although the co-creation principle applies equally for suppliers, partners, and employees, let us start by illustrating how value co-creation works with customers. In the conventional enterprise, customers are largely passive in the process of value creation. They are researched, observed, segmented, targeted, marketed at, and sold to by people in the organization, but they are not engaged in any meaningful interaction with the organization, on their terms. To use common business terminology, the organization has established &#x201c;touch points&#x201d; for them, but these touch points are scarce and brief, and they are all staged from the perspective of the organization. The organization decides what those touch points are and how the relationship with the individual is defined. Individuals do not get to decide what they are to share with the enterprise, but instead answer the questions asked of them at the focus group. They do not participate in the design of the product or service or program, but are only presented with an offering designed for them by the organization. They do not participate in the marketing of the offering, but only get to see the campaign aimed at them. They do not sell the offering to each other; the organization sells it to them. They are left with a yes-or-no decision, a modern capitalistic equivalent of Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Hamlet</i>: &#x201c;to buy or not to buy.&#x201d; Throughout, the organization views value as a function of its activities, ignoring the role of individuals and their activities in the shaping of value. This firm-centric paradigm of the conventional enterprise has served us well for many years, but it is rapidly becoming obsolete.<br> <br>As we will see in this book, the future belongs to the <i>co-creative enterprise</i>. Co-creation involves both a profound democratization and decentralization of value creation, moving it from concentration inside the firm to interactions with its customers, customer communities, suppliers, partners, and employees, and interactions among individuals. Once an organization accepts this premise, it starts on a journey that will require it to develop new capabilities. First, the organization needs to use the experience of individuals as the starting point, rather than its own products and services. In addition, the development of compelling experiences with individuals requires that they be allowed to engage in interactions of their own choosing. In co-creative enterprises, individuals participate in the design of value through their own experiences, which leads to a recasting of the conventional role of strategy, innovation, marketing, supply chain management, human resources management, and information technology.<br> <br>The co-creative enterprise is also a formidable productivity engine that can pay for itself many times over, in the same way that the quality movement and Six Sigma process-based practices have increased productivity by increasing worker engagement. In addition to cutting costs and improving efficiency, co-creation reduces business risk. Most important, the co-creative enterprise is a growth engine. It enhances strategic capital, increases returns, and expands market opportunities. Co-creation draws innovative ideas from customers, employees, and stakeholders at large. It increases the capacity of firms to generate insights and take advantage of opportunities they might not have identified, while reducing risk and capital needs by using global networks and communities. To illustrate a co-creative enterprise in action and the power of value co-creation, consider Nike.<br> <b>Nike as a Co-Creative Enterprise</b><p></p> <br>After Apple introduced the iPod in 2001, employees on the Nike campus started to notice many runners sporting ubiquitous white earbuds. As Nike&#x2019;s senior managers traveled globally, they came back seeing the connection between running and music in a different light. In the words of Nike&#x2019;s president and CEO Mark Parker, &#x201c;Most runners were running with music already. We thought the real opportunity would come if we could combine music and data.&#x201d;3<br> <br>In 2006, Nike launched Nike+ (pronounced NikePlus), an initiative in partnership with Apple to engage more deeply with runners and the running community at large. Nike+ consists of a smart sensor on the shoe that can communicate with a built-in wireless receiver on the iPod Touch or iPhone. As you listen to music and run, the sensor electronically logs the time and distance of the run, keeping track of any records being set. When a new record is set, a voice-over recorded by Lance Armstrong offers congratulations and provides encouragement. And once you are done running, you can go online to the Nike+ website (www.nikeplus.com), upload data from your run, chart it, analyze it, and share it with other runners. Runners can set individual goals, track their progress, and challenge other runners.4<br> <br>Nike+ goes beyond an agglomeration of devices and websites, however. To appreciate the co-creativity of Nike+, let us see how a runner actually engages with this platform and with other runners. Meet our protagonist runner, &#x201c;Youtou,&#x201d; as she is affectionately called. She has had a passion for running from a young age and takes running seriously. She works with a global firm and enjoys watching soccer and sports in general. Youtou is not just a statistic in a company database or someone to be &#x201c;targeted,&#x201d; but a living, breathing human being who cares about the quality of her running experience.<br> <br>Youtou is training for a half-marathon in London in five months. She has set a goal of finishing in less than an hour and a half, a highly ambitious time given where she is today. It is an opportunity to prove her competitiveness to herself and others. Let us identify the various interactions Youtou can engage in through Nike+. Her experience is ultimately the result of all those interactions. First, using the Run Tracking feature, she can now automatically plot distance, time, pace, and calories burned. She can display a friendly, colorful histogram of any set of data over time, assessing whether she is making progress. No need to log her runs into spreadsheets on her laptop manually every day as she used to, serious runner that she is. She can also issue running challenges to others through the Challenge Others feature. Here, she may let her competitive streak run free and dare the kids at her office to beat the time she recorded yesterday on their favorite &#x201c;run around the Park Plaza&#x201d; course. She may issue her challenge as an individual or as part of a team. The challenge may be, for example, about the total number of miles that her team can run over a set period of time&#x2014;say, 30 days&#x2014;thereby fostering motivation within each team. &#x201c;Hey buddy, how about logging a couple of miles for the team this evening?&#x201d; Youtou can also put herself out there and publish a Running Resolution, whereby she intends to run at least 1,000 miles over the next five months. She can already hear the electronic cheering coming from friends and relatives as she accumulates a few more miles every day, not to mention the emotional lift she receives from congratulatory messages from Lance Armstrong as she passes certain milestones.<br> <br>Youtou can now Map and Share Her Runs. Every time she establishes a new course, she can view it on a Google map, through a partnership between Nike and Google. She can also make that map available to others, annotating it with detailed data such as the nature of the road terrain and whether the course is well lit or not. When Youtou is sent to London on business, she can now download local data and find the popular running places around the hotel where she is staying. Of course, Youtou can Listen to Music on her iPod Touch. In the words of the Nike+ website, she can &#x201c;hear how she runs.&#x201d; Many athletes will tell you that there is a unique symbiosis between sports and music rhythms, which Nike+ capitalizes on. Youtou can also Publish Her Running Playlists. And who knows? Her iTunes iMix playlist tuned to the running rhythm of people like her may become a hit. She might become a contributor to popular iMixes and stoke the teenage aspiration she once had to become a music producer.<br> <br>Through Nike+, Youtou can also join local Nike Running Clubs. There, she will be able to attend running clinics and participate in runner reward programs. She can also sign up for Nike-Sponsored Events such as a five-kilometer run on Valentine&#x2019;s Day in the streets of New York. Youtou can engage in virtual Training with a Running Coach or Interact with Running Stars. There, she can get into a personal discussion on how quickly she should start running again after her pregnancy, or why her running pace seems to be hitting a wall after steadily improving for the last year. More broadly, she can join a variety of Blog and Discussion Board interactions with the larger running community, covering topics as diverse as running shoes, clothing, personal stories, and, as the Nike+ website indicates, &#x201c;everything running.&#x201d;<br> <br>Notice how active Youtou can be throughout in defining her running experience. She can create her own running courses, potentially building on what others have devised before her. She can decide whether to engage with training specialists or professional runners, based on the specific issues she faces. She can share her wisdom and running tips, based on what works for her. She can decide to seek encouragement and support in training for the half-marathon in London in five months. In all those cases, <i>she</i> initiates the contact, rather than passively wait for someone to reach out to her. She can share feelings or data about herself. She can be creative and exh...</p><h2>Bathroom Almanac</h2><p>A compendium of maxims, anecdotes, poems, quotations, trivia questions, and unusual facts for each day of the year</p><p></p><h2>When They Call You A Terrorist</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

In her love poems the threat of failure goes both ways, and amnesia is never in the offing. The dizzying verses in <i>Interior with Sudden Joy</i> veer between adoration and the inevitable, since "espionage of flesh roots in the dirt / of the heart." One is titled "You're Not Home, It's Probably Better," which is either hilarious or heartbreaking, depending on your mood. Another begins, "Let this one clear square of thought be just / like a room you could come in to." Beautiful, no? <p> In Shaughnessy's visceral wonderland, obsession and poison go hand in hand, mirrors make people vanish, and nuns are definitely not safe in their alabaster chambers. She's ever intent on rescuing (or wresting) us from our easy beliefs. "The Question and Its Mark" is her stunning take on the myth of Leda and the Swan, its final couplet reading: "Leda possessed a pair of knees that also bent / in prayer. I ask of you only what she asked for there." Yes, this poet knows her tropes, and has a sure synesthetic touch. Her pairs of women are "hot with mixed / light drunk with insult," and her private language--in which words such as <i>blue</i>, <i>strumpet</i>, and <i>silver</i> reverberate--soon becomes a kind of lingua franca between her and the reader. In her debut, Shaughnessy's debt to the surrealists, particularly to Dorothea Tanning, is visible and audible on each page. She's also a distant and distancing poetic relative of Sylvia Plath, wielding a similar jaunty threat. "Epithalament," her twist of an epithalamium, invokes a woman lost--and begins: "Other weddings are so shrewd on the sofa, short / and baffled, basset-legged." What better combination could there be of tradition, the individual talent, and the razor-sharp imagination? <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><p><b>Brenda Shaughnessy</b> was raised in California and is a graduate of Columbia University's writing program.

Kindergarten-Grade 3 These precious and didactic stories are written by the author of the ``Serendipity Books'' (Multnomah) ``to communicate moral values to children.'' Fiddler uses a ``Stone Soup'' motif to entice three selfish bears from their countrified lairs to share honey, bumbleberries, and biscuits. Lest young readers miss the point, Cosgrove's fiddling bear sings ``the gift of sharing is the way to live. . .you'll find sharing love is better than money.'' In Shadow Chaser, Gabriel Groundhog won't come out of his bedroom because he is ``afraid of imaginary creatures that he thought hid in the winter's shadows. He felt that the best place to hide from his fears was behind a dream.'' Later, with the help of a bunny (the text says he has mittened hands but the picture shows gloves or bare rabbit digits) and his friends, who make disembodied hand shadows on the wall, Gabriel is able to laugh and go outside. Friendship has conquered fear. A surfeit of alliteration and adjectives (``a fireplace filled with golden glowing embers''; ``Fiddler plopped himself down. . .beside the table of plain pine planks'') get in the way of the narrative almost as if the storyteller were watching himself tell his stories. The watercolor-and-ink illustrations, crammed with prettified and overdone detail, suit the text perfectly.

This story was written to let you know how one very young, very scared marine saw his very first war and how he reacted to the killing and the mayhem of it. The stories are my view of that war, a war gone to ground in the trench lines. Dig into the stories and you may find something you were not expecting. <p>I am well aware that my view of the Korean War has no historical importance. Still, it is my view, and I want to share it with you. I do not have a cause to plead or an ax to grind, and that alone ought to count for something. My memoirs are selective and most certainly tainted with time. My recollections are a lot like boot mines, and ought to be approached with caution. </p><p>I was a grunt, a Four Deuce forward observer, assigned to duty with a marine infantry company every time the 1st Marine Regiment went back up on line. During the time I was in Korea my boondockers were firmly planted in trench-line mud. When I came home in September 1952, I was proud that I had helped in the attempt to stop Communism in Korea. I was proud of all the men I served, and served with, and I was a little bit proud of myself, too.</p>Crawford served with the Marines during the Korean War as a forward observer in a 4.2 mortar company. But fire-missions interested him less than the doings of fellow enlisted men, who seemed to devote much time and effort to hoodwinking officers, making midnight requisitions from U.S. Army depots and generally behaving like "characters." In combat, the author got banged around a good bit, but couldn't manage to earn an official Purple Heart wound. The story of his attempts to achieve this goal is virtually the only unifying theme in this collection of wartime anecdotes and tall tales. Marines of all ages will enjoy Crawford's yarns. Others may wonder how so many devilishly clever, cynical, foul-mouthed and courageous young men could possibly end up in one outfit. Crawford spent 21 years in the Corps, serving in all ranks from private to master sergeant. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>More Two Minute Mysteries</h2><p>Asks readers to assist master detective Dr. Haledjian as he outwits villains in sixty-two mysteries</p><p></p><h2>Puff-Puff, Chugga-Chugga</h2><p>When three large animal passengers with three very large packages board his little train, the conductor fears the worse, in an amusing and brightly illustrated picture book by the creator of An Alphabet of Animals.</p><p><b>Chris Wormell</b> studied painting and linoleum cutting with his father, and in 1982 he took up wood engraving. He has worked in the fields of advertising and design and has written several books for adults and children. The first book he both wrote and illustrated, <i>An Alphabet of Animals,</i> was made for his son Jack and won the Graphics Prize at the Bologna International Children's Book Fair in 1991. <p> Mr. Wormell lives with his wife and three children in London.</p>"I have a funny feeling today will be a busy one," the train conductor thinks to himself in the opening of Wormell's (Blue Rabbit and Friends) latest success. And he's right. Hilariously rotund Mrs. Walrus, Mr. Bear and Mrs. Elephant each pour themselves into a car of the train. In town, they virtually clean out the shelves of the fishmonger, baker and greengrocer. Wormell portrays the tiny locomotive as the wooden-toy variety, with open cars in bright colors of red, blue, yellow and pink, linked by tongue-in-groove hitches. The cozy train is overwhelmed by its passengers, precariously balancing their packages. Just when the dwarfed conductor seems to be at the end of his rope, Mrs. Elephant sneezes, hurling the riders and their groceries hither and yon and derailing the train. A distinctly British brand of ingenuity and unflappability in the face of calamity informs the animals' calm response ("It's just a question of leverage," says Mrs. Elephant matter-of-factly to the panicked conductor, as she helps put the train back on its tracks). But even readers on this side of the pond will find the resolution witty. Wormell humorously emphasizes the animals' amazing girth in contrast to the toy train's diminutive size, while simultaneously evoking the calm beauty of the Victorian picture book. Every tableau is a feast of elegant, formal lines and patinaed colors.

His second novel, <i>Noggin</i>, was a 2014 National Book Award finalist. He lives in Newport Beach, California.<b>ONE</b><br><br> <b>SOLOMON REED<br> </b><br> Solomon never needed to leave the house anyway. He had food. He had water. He could see the mountains from his bedroom window, and his parents were so busy all the time that he pretty much got to be sole ruler of the house. Jason and Valerie Reed let it be this way because, eventually, giving in to their son&#x2019;s condition was the only way to make him better. So, by the time he turned sixteen, he hadn&#x2019;t left the house in three years, two months, and one day. He was pale and chronically barefoot and it worked. It was the only thing that ever had.<br><br> He did his schoolwork online&#x2014;usually finishing it before his parents were home every evening, with bed head and pajamas on. If the phone rang, he&#x2019;d let it go to voice mail. And, on the rare occasion that someone knocked on the door, he would look through the peephole until whoever it was&#x2014;a Girl Scout, a politician, or maybe a neighbor&#x2014;would give up and leave. Solomon lived in the only world that would have him. And even though it was quiet and mundane and sometimes lonely, it never got out of control.<br><br> He hadn&#x2019;t made the decision lightly, and it should be said that he at least tried to make it out there for as long as possible, for as long as anyone like him could. Then one day trying wasn&#x2019;t enough, so he stripped down to his boxers and sat in the fountain in front of his junior high school. And right there, with his classmates and teachers watching, with the morning sun blinding him, he slowly leaned back until his entire body was underwater.<br><br> That was the last time Solomon Reed went to Upland Junior High and, within a matter of days, he started refusing to go outside altogether. It was better that way.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better this way,&#x201d; he said to his mom, who begged him each morning to try harder.<br><br> And really, it was. His panic attacks had been happening since he was eleven, but over the course of just two years, he&#x2019;d gone from having one every few months, to once a month, to twice, and so on. By the time he hopped into the fountain like a lunatic, he was having mild to severe panic attacks up to three times daily.<br><br> It was hell.<br><br> After the fountain, he realized what he had to do. Take away the things that make you panic and you won&#x2019;t panic. And then he spent three years wondering why everyone found that so hard to understand. All he was doing was living instead of dying. Some people get cancer. Some people get crazy. Nobody tries to take the chemo away.<br><br> Solomon was born and will, in all likelihood, die in Upland, California. Upland is a suburb of Los Angeles, just about an hour east of downtown. It&#x2019;s in a part of the state they call the Inland Empire, which really floats Solomon&#x2019;s boat because it sounds like something from Star Trek, which is a television show he knows far too much about.<br><br> His parents, Jason and Valerie, don&#x2019;t know too much about Star Trek, despite their son&#x2019;s insistence that it&#x2019;s a brilliant exploration of humanity. It makes him happy, though, so they&#x2019;ll watch an episode with him every now and then. They even ask questions about the characters from time to time just so they can see that excited look he gets.<br><br> Valerie Reed is a dentist with her own practice in Upland, and Jason builds movie sets on a studio lot in Burbank. You&#x2019;d think this would lead to some great stories from work, but Jason&#x2019;s the kind of guy who thinks Dermot Mulroney and Dylan McDermott are interchangeable, so most of his celebrity sightings can&#x2019;t be trusted.<br><br> A week after he turned sixteen, Solomon was growing impatient as his dad tried to tell him about an actor he&#x2019;d seen on set earlier that day.<br><br> &#x201c;You know...the guy with the mustache. From the show...the show with the theme song...&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s every show on TV, Dad.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, you know the guy. The gun guy!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The gun guy? What does that even mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The guy. He holds the gun in the opening thing. I know you know the guy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Hawaii Five-O?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a movie, not an actor,&#x201d; his dad said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a television show. How can you work in Hollywood?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You get your schoolwork done today?&#x201d; Solomon&#x2019;s mom asked as she walked into the living room.<br><br> &#x201c;This morning. How was work?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I got a new patient today.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Keep bringing in those big bucks!&#x201d; his dad joked.<br><br> Nobody laughed.<br><br> &#x201c;She says she went to Upland Junior High. Lisa Praytor? Does that ring a bell?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Solomon replied.<br><br> &#x201c;Nice girl. Beautiful molars. But she&#x2019;s going to need to get those wisdom teeth out in a year or two or she&#x2019;ll have to get <br> braces all over again.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did you have braces?&#x201d; Solomon asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Headgear. It was awful.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, it all makes sense now. You want to put others through the torture of your childhood.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t analyze me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Solomon, stop analyzing your mother,&#x201d; his dad said from behind a book, one of those creepy mystery novels he was always reading.<br><br> &#x201c;Anyway, she&#x2019;s a nice girl. Pretty too. Only one cavity.&#x201d;<br><br> Solomon knew good and well what was going on. His mom was doing that thing she did where she thought talking about some pretty girl would suddenly cure her son and have him walking right out the front door and straight to high school. It was innocent enough, but he hoped she wasn&#x2019;t actually that desperate for him to change. Because, if she was, then wouldn&#x2019;t these little moments, built up over time, eventually collapse into a mess?<br><br> He&#x2019;d heard their conversations about him a few times. When he was ten he learned that if he held a plastic cup against his bedroom wall, he could hear everything his parents were saying in their bedroom. The last time he listened was when his mom asked his dad if they were going to be &#x201c;stuck with him forever.&#x201d; After she said it, he didn&#x2019;t hear anything for a while. Then he realized it was because she&#x2019;d started crying as soon as the words left her mouth. Hours later, Solomon was still awake wondering how to answer his mother&#x2019;s question. He eventually decided on a hard yes.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>TWO</b><br><br> <b>LISA PRAYTOR</b><br><br> Sometimes life just hands you the lemonade, straight up in a chilled glass with a little slice of lemon on top. For Lisa Praytor, junior and straight-A student at Upland High, meeting Solomon Reed&#x2019;s mother was that glass of lemonade. And it was going to change her life.<br><br> You may have known a Lisa Praytor at some point. She was the girl sitting at the front of your classroom, raising her hand to answer every single question the teacher asked. She stayed after school to work on the yearbook and as soon as she got home, she dove headfirst into her homework.<br><br> She&#x2019;d always been one to keep a packed schedule, choosing at age eleven to live by the words of her great-aunt Dolores, who said, &#x201c;Not a day on your calendar should ever be empty. It&#x2019;s bad luck. Twenty-four hours of wasted opportunity.&#x201d;<br><br> Not even an offer from her boyfriend to drive to the coast and watch the sunset could tempt her off schedule. And Clark Robbins was the kind of guy who asked her to do things like that all the time. He was handsome without being threatening, and his tree-bark brown hair parted in a way that was particularly appealing to Lisa. On the day that Lisa met Solomon&#x2019;s mom, she&#x2019;d been dating Clark for a year and seventeen days. She had it marked on her calendar for proof.<br><br> During eighth grade, after a seventh grader had an episode in front of the school, Lisa wrote an op-ed piece for the Upland Junior High Register to defend the boy&#x2014;a scathing essay on the importance of empathy. It didn&#x2019;t go over well with her classmates and until the end of the year, rumors swirled around that Lisa was secretly dating the crazy kid who jumped into the fountain.<br><br> Had it not been for the student body of nearly one thousand at Upland Junior High, Lisa may not have been able to escape her failed attempt at heroism when she got to high school. She did, though, and most of her friends and classmates eventually forgot about it altogether.<br><br> But not Lisa. She&#x2019;d seen him that day&#x2014;this skinny little guy with messy hair taking his shirt off and dropping his pants and walking that slow, quiet walk toward the water. She never knew him, really, but she&#x2019;d always thought he looked nice, like the kind of guy who&#x2019;d hold a door open for someone else without a thought. And she&#x2019;d always hoped that someday she&#x2019;d see him again or, at the very least, hear that he was doing okay.<br><br> Then one day, Lisa saw an advertisement for Valerie Reed&#x2019;s dental practice in the local newspaper. It took one Internet search to confirm that this was Solomon&#x2019;s mother. She&#x2019;d never really been looking for the fountain kid, despite thinking about him from time to time and wondering where he&#x2019;d ended up. But the second she realized she&#x2019;d found him, she knew she had to get to him as soon as possible. And the only way to do that was to make an appointment with his mom. At the very least, Lisa would get a nice teeth cleaning and a free toothbrush. At the very best, she&#x2019;d make all her dreams come true.<br><br> &#x201c;So, where do you go to school?&#x201d; Dr. Valerie Reed asked as she sat down to examine Lisa&#x2019;s teeth. It was March twenty-fourth, a Tuesday, and Lisa was having a really hard time not asking a million questions about Solomon.<br><br> &#x201c;Upland High. Are you Solomon&#x2019;s mother?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she answered, slightly taken aback.<br><br> &#x201c;I went to junior high with him. His picture&#x2019;s on the wall,&#x201d; she smiled, pointing across the room to a photograph of Valerie, Jason, and Solomon hanging by the window.<br><br> &#x201c;You knew him?&#x201d; Valerie asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Knew him?&#x201d; Lisa asked. &#x201c;Oh! Did he ... ?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No. God no. Sorry,&#x201d; Valerie said. &#x201c;He just doesn&#x2019;t get out much.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Private school? Western Christian?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s homeschooled.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You do that and this?&#x201d; Lisa asked.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all online. Okay, lean back for me. Open wide.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was there you know,&#x201d; Lisa said, sitting straight up.<br><br> &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; Dr. Reed asked. She was beginning to look a little frustrated.<br><br> &#x201c;That morning. I saw your son ... I saw his incident.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It was a panic attack,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Can I get a look at those teeth now?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just one more thing,&#x201d; Lisa said.<br><br> &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why doesn&#x2019;t he get out much?&#x201d;<br><br> Dr. Reed stared down at her in silence, her mouth covered with a blue paper mask, but her eyes searching for the right answer. And just when she went to speak, Lisa interrupted her.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just ... no one&#x2019;s seen him in so long. He was there and then he wasn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s strange is all. I thought maybe he went off to boarding school or something.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He made it one day at Western Christian. What do you do if your kid won&#x2019;t leave the house?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Homeschool him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It was our only option. Open wide.&#x201d;<br><br> As soon as Dr. Reed was done, Lisa picked right back up where she&#x2019;d left off, not even waiting for her chair to be all the way upright again.<br><br> &#x201c;When was the last time he left the house?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You sure are inquisitive, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Gosh, I&#x2019;m so sorry. I never meant to be nosy. I&#x2019;ve just thought a lot about him over the last few years and when I realized you were his mom, I guess I got too excited.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just glad somebody remembers him. It&#x2019;s been three years. A little over, actually.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is he okay?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mostly, yeah. We make it work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Must get lonely,&#x201d; Lisa said.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think that, yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Does he have any friends?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not anymore. Used to though. You guys all grow up so fast. He just couldn&#x2019;t keep up.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can you tell him I say hello? I doubt he&#x2019;ll know who I am, but just, you know, if it&#x2019;s not weird.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell him, Lisa. And I&#x2019;ll see you next Tuesday to get this cavity fixed up.&#x201d;<br><br> Lying to adults was a little easier for Lisa than lying to her peers. Just like herself, none of her friends or classmates really trusted anyone, so lying was hard to get away with. But take someone like Valerie Reed, DDS, probably born in the late seventies to Southern California liberals, and you&#x2019;ve got an easy target&#x2014;someone who wants to trust everyone so much that they don&#x2019;t see a lie when it&#x2019;s slapping them right in the face.<br><br> In the grand scheme of things, Lisa knew it was harmless, a necessary step in taking her master plan from concept to actuality. And what a plan it was.<br><br> She was going to fix Solomon Reed.<br><br> Her life depended on it.</p><h2>The 5 Solas Gift Book: In Christ Alone</h2><p>Five hundred years ago, the Catholic priest and monk Martin Luther nailed his "Ninety-five Theses" on the church door in Wittenburg, Germany to publicly protest against what he saw as Medieval Roman Catholicism's abusive practices in the sale of indulgences.

Throughout the Hispanic Americas and the southwestern U.S., generations of young people have heard the tale of "La Llorona," the crying woman who killed her children long ago and who wanders through the night wailing with grief and sometimes kidnapping unchaperoned youngsters. In this less violent version of the story, Anaya has created Maya, a baby born in ancient Mexico with a sun-shaped birthmark that renders her immortal. Angered by her immortality, Se?or Tiempo, the god of time, vows to destroy Maya's future offspring. When she grows up and longs for companionship, an owl tells her how to grow babies in clay pots. If she saves the pots, the owl says, Se?or Tiempo cannot hurt her children. Sadly, the god tricks Maya into throwing the pots into a lake, and the youngsters perish. Maya's pain-filled wails can still be heard at night. Although the original folktale is frightening, Anaya's poetic retelling is sad and wistful. Ethereal, gouache figures give the story a timeless, fantastic look. Pervasive dark shades heighten the tragedy. Children might enjoy comparing Joe Hayes's La Llorona (Cinco Puntos, 1986), a traditional rendition, with this variant. Gloria Anzaldua's Prietita and the Ghost Woman (Children's Book Press, 1996) is also a gentler version of the story, but superior prose and a clearer explanation of La Llorona's misfortune make Anaya's retelling the better choice.?Denise E. Agosto, Midland County Public Library, TX<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 6^-9. A celebrated Chicano writer offers his version of the Latin American legend of La Llorona, "the crying woman." In ancient Mexico, a daughter of the sun god is born to human parents. She is named Maya and is destined to live forever. That angers Senor Tiempo, the god of time, who jealously vows to find a way to ensure that Maya's immortality will not be passed on to her children. In an author's note, Anaya explains that he has tempered the violence of the original tale and made Maya a sympathetic character rather than one designed to frighten children. Instead, Senor Tiempo becomes "the bad guy," and a traditional tale becomes a lesson to "teach youngsters about mortality." Fortunately the story is less didactic than Anaya's description. Baca's gouache illustrations are notable for the richness of their colors and the beautiful borders that frame them. <i>Michael Cart</i></p><h2>The Wealth of Nations</h2><p>The Wealth of Nations was published 9 March 1776, during the Scottish Enlightenment and the Scottish Agricultural Revolution. It influenced a number of authors and economists, as well as governments and organizations. For example, Alexander Hamilton was influenced in part by The Wealth of Nations to write his Report on Manufactures, in which he argued against many of Smith&#39;s policies. Interestingly, Hamilton based much of this report on the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and it was, in part, Colbert&#39;s ideas that Smith responded to with The Wealth of Nations. Many other authors were influenced by the book and used it as a starting point in their own work, including Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and, later, Ludwig von Mises. The Russian national poet Aleksandr Pushkin refers to The Wealth of Nations in his 1833 verse-novel Eugene Onegin.</p><p>The Wealth of Nations<br>by Adam Smith <br>It is symbolic that Adam Smith's masterpiece of economic analysis, The Wealth of Nations, was first published in 1776, the same year as the "Declaration of Independence. <br>In his book, Smith fervently extolled the simple yet enlightened notion that individuals are fully capable of setting and regulating prices for their own goods and services. He argued passionately in favor of free trade, yet stood up for the little guy. The Wealth of Nations provided the first--and still the most eloquent--integrated description of the workings of a market economy. <br>The result of Smith's efforts is a witty, highly readable work of genius filled with prescient theories that form the basis of a thriving capitalist system. This unabridged edition offers the modern reader a fresh look at a timeless and seminal work that revolutionized the way governments and individuals view the creation and dispersion of wealth--and that continues to influence our economy right up to the present day."Adam Smith's enormous authority resides, in the end, in the same property that we discover in Marx: not in any ideology, but in an effort to see to the bottom of things."<br>--Robert L.

Follow the widowed Margaret Ralston Kennedy (a relative of the author) in this second book of the Trail of Thread series, as she travels with eight of her thirteen children from Ohio to the Territory of Kansas in 1855. Thousands of American headed west in the decade before the Civil War, but those who settled in Kansas suffered through the frequent clashes between proslavery and free-state fractions that gripped the territory. Margaret was dedicated to the cause of the North, and while the male members of her family were away fighting for a free state, she valiantly defended their homestead and held their families together through the savage years of Bleeding Kansas. Told through her letters, Thimble of Soil describes the prevalent hardships and infrequent joys experienced by the hardy pioneer women of Kansas, who struggled to protect their families from terrorist raids while building new homes and new lives on the vast unbroken prairie. Watch for the twelve quilt patterns mentioned in the letters.</p><p>In sixth grade we had to write a paper on what we wanted to do when we grew up. My mom had kept it and I found this paper while cleaning through my closet during my college days. According to my dreams back then, I wanted to be a farmer, but my last line was -but alas, girls can&#39;t be farmers. Well, I got my Bachelors Degree in Agriculture/Horticulture from Kansas State University, did agronomy research for years before starting a wholesale horticulture business. My company, Prairie Flower Creations, grew and dried flowers, ornamental corn, and mini pumpkins for the florist trade. In 1990 I was featured in Country Woman Magazine, but at the same time, my husband&#39;s job was transferred to California. I sold my business and tried to cope, growing flowers and pumpkins in five-gallon buckets on our cement lawn. I started writing about the family and farmland I was homesick for and started a new career, writing about women ancestors who had moved to the new state of Kansas and farmed its land. We eventually moved back to Kansas, bought land next to my family, raised buffalo, and I have a garden again. So not only have I fulfilled my dream to be a farmer, I&#39;ve written about past and present women that have also tilled the prairie land of Kansas. Please read and enjoy my book series which are about the family that homestead our family farm, and my ancestors that homesteaded in Kansas in the 1800s. Considered historical fiction, these quality paperback books are age appropriate for everyone from age 9 to 99. Book, quilt, and Scandinavian gift shops sell them (or ask your local store to stock them for you) and schools use them in class studies to portray early pioneer and Kansas history.

The author portrays them as the most accomplished travelling and adventuring couple of the 20th century. Miles Smeeton has written nine books including &#34;Once is Enough&#34;, &#34;Because the Horn Was There&#34;, and &#34;The Sea Was Our Village&#34;, which earned him the reputation of adventurer, sailor, conservationist and storyteller. As a young army officer in 1934, he fell in love with the Commanding Officer&#39;s wife - Beryl Boxer - during a 6000-mile overland journey from India to England. At that stage she had already travelled alone across four continents on foot and horseback. After the war, they mountaineered and sailed, cruising the oceans under sail, before settling in the Rockies in 1969 to spend their last 20 years breeding endangered Canadian wild animals.</p><p>Miles and Beryl Smeeton were perhaps the most adventurous couple of the 20th century. Separately and together, they traveled around the world by boat and on foot along some of the most dangerous routes, trekking across China and sailing around Cape Horn. While the couple wrote several travel books, little has been written about their lives. Writer and photographer Miles Clark, who died in 1993, documented the couple's adventures in High Endeavours: The Extraordinary Life and Adventures of Miles and Beryl Smeeton, first published in Canada 10 years ago and now being released in the U.S. The biographical portrait incorporates some of the couple's own writings. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hollis Sigler&#39;s Breast Cancer Journal</h2><p>Hollis Sigler, a leading feminist artist, was diagnosed in 1985 with breast cancer. After it reacurred, she began a pictorial journal, now encompassing more than 100 works.</p><p>A Chicago-based artist, Sigler learned in 1986 that she, like her mother and grandmother, had breast cancer. Five years later, the cancer had spread to Sigler&#39;s bones, inspiring the captivating small-scale paintings featured in this powerful book, in which she unflinchingly traces the perilous psychic journey a woman makes as she combats the disease. The pieces have an introspective yet schematic feel similar to the work of Chicago Imagist Jim Nutt. Because Sigler constructs her symmetrical paintings in bright, jewel-tone colors, they also recall the work of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. (An essay by James Yood traces Sigler&#39;s career as an artist, and a brief text by Sigler describes the history of her work.) Occasionally, Sigler uses cut paper to create her domestic scenes of beds, dresses and vanities in which no one seems to be at home. In some works, the right breast has been slashed from the dresses and blood rains from the sky. Because the reproductions are relatively small, the statistics on cancer and the private thoughts the artist has inscribed on the frames of her paintings are reprinted at the bottom of each page. Readers don&#39;t have to have cancer to relate to the sentiments expressed in works like &#34;Having to Beat the Odds&#34;--although as breast cancer specialist Dr. Susan M. Love notes in her foreword, the disease still kills 30% of its victims.Artist Sigler began this series of paintings in 1992 after her second bout with breast cancer. Sigler has now had a second recurrence, but she continues to work and to see cancer as a positive force, making each day something to look forward to and acknowledging that giving up control over something that is beyond one's control is liberating. The brightly colored, symbolic pieces feature recurring themes of loss (leafless/limbless trees), a heightened sense of personal awareness (a vanity table), and the death of her mother in 1995, also from breast cancer (a dress). Sigler often includes text in the form of statistics, journal entries, or inspirational texts (e.g., from Audre Lorde's The Cancer Journals) written on the frames and mats of her paintings; these are clearly printed here for easier reading below the fine reproductions. The introduction by art critic and author Yood establishes Sigler's progression in the art world. And breast cancer advocate Susan Love's foreword acknowledges the grace and ultimate value of these works in a world where a cancer cure is not yet near enough. Those interested in cancer matters will find Sigler's texts as enlightening as they are alarming; the book will move those affected by breast cancer as well as those attracted by the art.

There was a bright flash; every window shattered as the car heaved on its suspension. Mike Fleming, standing in his doorway with keyfob remote raised, had no time to blink; the pressure wave shoved him backward and he stumbled, falling against the doorframe. In the ringing moment of silence after the blast, car alarms went off up and down the street and panicking dogs added their voices to the chorus. The hot yellow light of burning plastic and seat cushions filtered through the empty windows of the car, warmth beating on Mike&#x2019;s face as he struggled to work out why he was sitting down with his legs askew, why the back of his head hurt&#x2014;</p><p>They want me dead, he realized, coldly. Then: Dr. James screwed up. It was an easy mistake to make. The technician who&#x2019;d planted the bomb had meant to wire it to the ignition circuit, but they&#x2019;d got the central locking instead. The fine art of car bombing had gotten positively esoteric in the past few years, with the proliferation of in-car electronics, remote-control engine starters, and other bells and whistles; and US government agents were more used to defusing the things than planting them. Then: But that means they&#x2019;re complicit for sure. The thought was shocking. It&#x2019;s Operation Northwoods, only this time they&#x2019;re doing it for real.</p><p>Mike reached up gingerly and felt the back of his head. There was going to be a nasty lump in a few hours, but his fingers came away dry. No bleeding. Taking stock, limb by limb, he took deep breaths, pushing down the wave of impending panic. I&#x2019;m alive, he told himself. Shaken but intact. He&#x2019;d been lucky; if he hadn&#x2019;t changed the batteries in his keyfob remote three months ago he might have been closer to the car, or even reduced to using the door key, with fatal results. As he stood up, something crunched underfoot. Fragments from the rear window, pea-sized pellets of safety glass. Bending down stiffly, he picked up his go-bag. His leg twinged hard inside its cast. What now? Clear the killing zone, the instructors had insisted, years before. But they&#x2019;d been talking about a different kind of ambush&#x2014;a car bomb was a passive trap. Probably they were relying on it. Probably . . . Mike pulled his pistol from the bag and duck-walked towards the street, edging around the burning car as he scanned for threats. In the distance, a siren began to scream.</p><p>Less than twenty seconds had elapsed.</p><p>"Duty Chief? This is the major. I have some orders for you.

Olga raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"What did Mr. Fleming say?" asked Riordan, ignoring her to focus on Miriam.</p><p>"It&#x2019;s&#x2014;" Miriam shook her head, punch-drunk. "Crazy talk.

"Why not?"</p><p>"He says he&#x2019;s disposable. He&#x2019;s going to try and find someone to talk to, but there&#x2019;s no point going through the chain of command.

Everyone stared at her&#x2014;even Sir Alasdair, by way of the rearview mirror.</p><p>"What do you mean, my lady?" Riordan&#x2019;s return to exaggerated courtesy was a sign of stress, screamingly clear to Miriam even in her punch-drunk state.</p><p>"We&#x2019;ve been looking for a second mole, ever since Matthias went over the wall, nearly a year ago.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>The Boeing 747, the jetliner which revolutionized air travel, was launched on its first commercial flight in 1970. For the past two decades, it has been the most popular large plane, with the wide body accommodating hundreds of passengers per flight. The exciting story of the events of the four years that led up to the triumphant debut of the 747 is ably told here by Conde Nast Traveler editor Irving. Boeing had made its reputation largely with military aircraft and was the first major company to believe that jets could serve as the civilian planes of the future. In producing the 747, the firm worked jointly with Pan Am, whose enigmatic, quixotic president, Juan Trippe, put constant pressure on the Seattle corporation, according to Irving. The interplay of personalities related here between Trippe and Boeing Chief Bill Allen is interesting, as are the clashes between two types of engineers: formulaic and intuitive. This is business history at its best. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This intriguing book is as much a history of commercial passenger aviation as it is of the development of the Boeing 747 wide-body jet airplane. Given the cast of characters, which is as large as that of War and Peace , remembering who is doing what can be difficult. At times, the story reads like a mystery and at times like a thriller. Behind the different business enterprises of building airplanes and providing air transport for the masses was an unlikely melding of the personalities: CEOs, chief engineers, lawyers, scientists, test pilots, and accountants. It is these diverse personalities who grab and hold the reader's interest, while the author spins his stranger-than-fiction tale of how the plane that couldn't fly not only flew but changed the face of intercontinental air travel.

Born out of the civil rights struggle, these now-classic translations of much of the New Testament bring the far-away places of Scripture closer to home: Gainesville, Selma, Birmingham, Atlanta, Washington D.C. As Jordan once wrote, &#x201c;While there have been many excellent translations of the Scriptures into modern English, they still have left us stranded in some faraway land in the long-distant past. We need to have the good news come to us not only in our own tongue but in our own time. We want to be participants in the faith, not merely �spectators.&#x201d; More than a translation, <em>The Cotton Patch Gospel</em> continues to make clear the startling relevance of Scripture for today. Now for the first time collected in a single, hardcover volume, this edition comes complete with a new Introduction by President Jimmy Carter, a Foreword by Will D. Campbell, and an Afterword by Tony Campolo. Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing is proud to help reintroduce these seminal works of Clarence Jordan to a new generation of believers.</p><p>orn in 1912 in Talbotton, Georgia, Clarence Jordan, a New Testament Greek scholar, was the founder of Koinonia Farm, an interracial, Christian farming community near Americus, Georgia. During the civil rights era, Jordan and Koinonia Farm believed that the best way to effect change in society was by living in peaceful community with one another. Through the work of Millard and Linda Fuller, residents of Koinonia Farm, Jordan also influenced the creation of Habit for Humanity, an organization dedicated to building simple, affordable housing around the world for those in need. In the 1960s, Jordan also turned his attention toward writing the Cotton Patch Gospels, a series of colloquial translations and retellings of much of the New Testament story in modern, relatable terms. More than a decade later, these writings provided the inspiration for the <em>Cotton Patch Gospel</em>, a musical by Tom Key and Russell Treyz with music and lyrics by Harry Chapin, that is a mainstay in community theatres across the country. Clarence Jordan died suddenly of a heart attack in 1969. But as a neighbor reflected long after Clarence&#x2019;s death, &#x201c;He be gone now, but his footprint is still here.&#x201d; Koinonia Farm lives on. The work of Millard and Linda Fuller lives on.

And the book itself, like the best poetry collections, is a gem offering one Twimerick per page, each illustrated in full-color by the author, a legendary commercial artist. Open to any page and feel the unbridled creative energy spilling out. It's pure happiness.<br></p><p>Lou Brooks is a renowned illustrator and comic artist whose work ranges from updating the "little guy in the top hat" logo design for the game Monopoly to, most recently, the '50s pulp-fiction-style illustrations for <i>The Book of Totally Irresponsible Science</i>. He has also designed and illustrated covers for <i>Time</i> and<i> Newsweek</i>, and in the 1970s created a comic strip for <i>Playboy</i> that achieved a cult following. He lives with his wife in a cabin in the woods several hours north of San Francisco.Grade 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;In this slim collection of lighthearted verse, Brooks fuses limericks and tongue twisters to create 30 "twimericks," including "Which Witch Was Which?": "Two witchy witches in a Wichita ditch,/One witch with a twitch caused the witches to switch,/The spell they were under,/Caused people to wonder,/Which Wichita witch switched was which?" The results are broadly humorous and frequently gross, as in "A Flatulent Platypus" and "Frankly, Frank Fankley," which centers on a snot-filled hanky. The manic, exaggerated cartoons perfectly complement the silly goings-on. This is a far cry from Edward Lear, but it should prove popular with fledgling readers who are discovering nonsense wordplay for the first time.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Add a cooler-than-thou con artist from Detroit who's out to take over the Dixie mafia's lucrative Gulf Coast drug business. Throw in a crooked deputy sheriff and an honest state cop. Put them all in costume along with a bunch of other "reenactors" bent on refighting an important Civil War battle, season with plenty of historic detail, and you've got all the classic ingredients of an Elmore Leonard novel--except for drama, suspense, or mystery, that is. This is a rib-tickler in the Carl Hiaasen/Dave Barry tradition rather than the kind of thriller Leonard wrote before Hollywood discovered him. As the author himself explains, his intent was to entertain himself by gathering an odd assortment of characters, building a story as they bump heads, and seeing what happens. And as usual, he carries it off with style, wit, and brio. Readers will be casting the inevitable movie in their heads (Samuel L. Jackson is a lock for Robert, who glides into town in a flashy Jag and gets the action going) as they chuckle their way to the last hilarious page. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Daredevil Dennis Lenahan has brought his act to the Tishomingo Lodge &amp; Casino in Tunica, Mississippi -- diving off an eighty-foot ladder into nine feet of water for the amusement of gamblers, gangsters, and luscious belles. His riskiest feat, however, was witnessing a Dixie-style mob execution while atop his diving platform. Robert Taylor saw the hit also. A blues-loving Detroit hustler touring the Southland in a black Jaguar, Taylor's got his own secret agenda re the "Cornbread Cosa Nostra," and he wants Dennis in on the game. But there's a lot more in Robert Taylor's pocket than a photo of his lynched great-grandfather. And high-diver Dennis could be about to take a long, fatal fall -- right into a mess of hoop skirts, Civil War play-acting ... and more trouble than he ever dreamed possible.</p></p><h2>Tom and Pippo Read a Story (Pippo, 1)</h2><p>A beginning readers book.

Can they count? Do they have emotions? Do they feel anger, frustration, hurt, or sorrow? Are they bound by any moral code? At last, here is a book that provides authoritative answers to these long-standing questions. Most pop-science books tend to anthropomorphize and romanticize animals, presenting them as furry little humans or as creatures that cannot think or feel at all. Marc Hauser, an acclaimed scientist in the field of animal cognition, uses insights from evolutionary theory and cognitive science to examine animal thought without such biases or preconceptions. For example, do species that share food or travel in large groups have greater innate mathematical abilities? Hauser treats animals neither as machines devoid of feeling nor as extensions of humans, but as independent beings driven by their own complex impulses. In prose that is both elegant and edifying, Hauser describes his groundbreaking research in the field, leading his readers on what David Premack, author of The Mind of an Ape, calls "a masterful tour of the animal mind."</p></p><p>What's that squirrel thinking as it runs across the street? Behavioral neuroscientist Marc D. Hauser asks big questions about little brains in <i>Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think</i>. While his subjects aren't accessible for interviews, he believes that we can gain insight into their interior lives by examining their behavior in the context of their social and physical environments. Thus, while comparing the actions of chimps, rats, honeybees, and human infants, he is careful to keep in mind that each of them has different needs that require different kinds of intelligence and emotion and ought not be judged by the same criteria. Looking at counting, mapmaking, self-understanding, deception, and other intelligent activities, Hauser shows that the birds and the bees have more on their minds than we've come to believe. Acknowledging the vast gulf of language that separates our species from all others, he still maintains that this tool is but one of many and is no better an indication of "superior" intelligence than is the bat's fantastically well-developed echolocation system. In the last chapter, Hauser looks at moral behavior and decides that animals can be "moral patients but not moral agents"--that is, their inability to attribute mental states to others keeps them blameless for their actions but their sensitivity to suffering earns them fair treatment from the rest of us. Whether or not you agree with that, you're sure to find <i>Wild Minds</i> a refreshing look at the thoughts of our mute cousins. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><p>Marc Hauser, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Harvard University, researches in Puerto Rico, and Uganda.

Mass market paperback, one of two printings. &#34;Lilith&#34; is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer George MacDonald and first published in 1895. Early and highly influential Christian fantasy novel.</p><p>"<i>Lilith</i> is equal if not superior to the best of Poe," the great 20th-century poet W.H. Auden said of this novel, but the comparison only begins to touch on the richness, density, and wonder of this late 19th-century adult fantasy novel. First published in 1895 (inhabiting a universe with the early Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, and Oscar Wilde--not to mention Thomas Hardy), this is the story of the aptly named Mr. Vane, his magical house, and the journeys into another world into which it leads him.<p> Meeting up with one mystery after another, including Adam and Eve themselves, he slowly but surely explores the mystery of the human fall from grace, and of our redemption. Instructed into the ways of seeing the deeper realities of this world--seeing, in a sense, by the light of the spirit--the reader and Mr. Vane both sense that MacDonald writes from his own deep experience of radiance, from a bliss so profound that death's darkness itself is utterly eclipsed in its light. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>(1824-1905) The great nineteenth-century innovator ofmodern fantasy, whose works influenced C.

Superintendent Markby is the first on the scene, and he must protect Tammy, as her father is the primary suspect. No one is talking, and Markby and Mitchell are faced with a truth far more complex than they imagined. <br></p><p>Ann Granger has lived in cities all over the world, since for many years she worked for the Foreign Office and received postings to British embassies as far apart as Munich and Lusaka. She is now permanently based in Oxfordshire.Yet another homicide for Superintendent Alan Markbys Bamford precinct (Call the Dead Again, 1999, etc.). Widower Hugh Franklin, owner of none-too-prosperous Hazelwood Farm and father of 12-year-old Tammy, had taken another wife, fun-loving, man-chasing Sonia Lambert. As might be predicted, the marriage had never worked too well, but Hugh, his bookish brother Simon, and everyone who knew her are shocked when Sonias body, stabbed to death, is found on a nearby railway embankment by gypsy Danny Smith. As Markby and newly promoted Inspector Dave Pearce begin their investigation, Jane Brady, Tammys teacher at St. Clares, tries to help but soon suspects that Tammy is hiding something. Markbys girlfriend Meredith Mitchell, a Foreign Service worker now based in London and owner of an ancient cottage in Bamford, also tries to help by checking out the suspects who had reason to cheer Sonias death. The line begins just down the road from Hazelwood Farm, at the modest B&amp;B run by Derry and Belinda Haywood. Derry was one of Sonias flings; so was woodworker Peter Burke, once involved with Jane. Simon Franklin, recently broken up and then reconciled with Bethan Talbot, was another of Sonias targets. Not until Merediths house has been thoroughly vandalizedand Derry Haywood viciously attacked, and Tammy has told alldoes the solution arrive. The customary assortment of intriguing locals adds interest and a bit of tension to a generally phlegmatic plot: a boon, nevertheless, to lovers of the British village procedural. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this volume, highly esteemed astrophysicist Joseph Silk explores the vast mysteries and speculations of the field of cosmology in a way that balances an accessible style for the general reader and enough technical detail for advanced students and professionals.&nbsp;Indeed, while the physical laws and origins of the universe can be endlessly complex, even Einstein once mused that they could be explained simply enough to be grasped by nonspecialists. To that end Silk begins by introducing the basic story of the major discoveries in cosmology over the past century&#x2014;wherein we learned that we live in an expanding universe populated with galaxies and stars. The middle chapters examine a number of contemporary puzzles such as dark matter and dark energy. The last third of the book looks at the human side of cosmology and moves to the more philosophical frontiers of the field, such as concepts of multiverses and time travel&#x2014;areas of exploration where some crossover into speculative territory becomes unavoidable.&nbsp;In the past century alone, our understanding of the universe has expanded exponentially, and it will be fascinating to see what discoveries the next hundred years hold. Few books will provide such a thorough understanding of where we have been and what might lie ahead as <i>Horizons of Cosmology</i>.<br></p><p>&#x201c;If you want to plunge into the complex and intriguing issues that engage modern cosmologists, rather than skim the surface of easy description, take this journey with Joseph Silk, who will lead you on a tour through dark matter, dark energy, black holes, galaxy formation, and the inflating and accelerating universe.&nbsp;Professor Silk, who knows these topics intimately from his long research career, does not hesitate to take his readers to the heart of the matter, allowing full comprehension to those who travel with him.&#x201d;&#x2014;Donald Goldsmith, coauthor of the script and companion volume for the PBS television program <i>Four Hundred Years of the Telescope</i>&nbsp;<i>Horizons of Cosmology: Exploring Worlds Seen and Unseen </i>is the fourth title published in the Templeton Science and Religion Series, in which scientists from a wide range of fields distill their experience and knowledge into brief tours of their respective specialties.

The experiences of these westering men have long been a part of the lore of the American frontier, but the stories of their wives have rarely been told. Ten years of research into public and private documents-including letters of couples separated during the westward movement-has enabled Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith to tell the forgotten stories of "women in waiting."</p> <p>Though these wives were left more or less in limbo by the departure of their adventuring husbands, they were hardly women in waiting in any other sense. Children had to be fed, clothed, housed, and educated; farms and businesses had to be managed; creditors had to be paid or pacified and, in some cases, hard-earned butter-and-egg money had to be sent west in response to letters from broke and disillusioned husbands.</p> <p>This raises some unsettling questions: How does the idea of an "allowance" from home square with our long-standing image of the frontiersman as rugged individualist? To what extent was the westward movement supported by the paid and unpaid labor of women back east? And how do we measure the heroics of husbands out west against the heroics of wives back home?</p></p><p><p><b>Ursula Smith </b>pursued graduate work at San Francisco State University under a Ford Foundation Fellowship and taught in the San Francisco school system.

When Emma Stratton Christie wrote these words in June of 1884, she and her five sons, aged seven months to nine years, were living in a tiny granary on her brother's Minnesota farm while her husband David was searching for the perfect homestead in the Montana Territory. He had already been absent for more than two years, with an occasional visit home, and it would be another year before the family was reunited in Montana--in a one-room cabin with a lean-to kitchen. Emma Christie was far from alone in her plight. Beginning with the California Gold Rush of 1849, tens of thousands of men left their families in search of gold, land or adventure, leaving their wives, sometimes for years at a time, to manage families and businesses on their own. Some women rose to the occasion, discovering a flair for business, while others waited in poverty, holding off debtors while trying to feed large families. Without detracting from the very real hardships and dangers endured by westering men, independent scholars Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith ( The Gold Rush Widows of Little Falls ) relate the experiences of more than 50 women, focusing on the stories of six, whose correspondence and diaries have survived in archives. The loneliness and fears of these all-but-abandoned women speak eloquently over the years. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Mao of Business: Guerrilla Trade Techniques for the New China</h2><p><p>In&nbsp;the past 20 years there has been an avalanche of books and articles on doing business in Asia, using what are commonly referred to as "Asian values." Most of these books rely upon the works of the Chinese classics, such Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>, or by classical Japanese authors such as Musashi's <i>Book of Five Rings</i>.</p><p>Peter Levenda, a seasoned trader with more than 20 years of experience dealing extensively (and successfully) with the Chinese market, contends that such books don't prepare anyone for the mundane practicalities of handling a Chinese business negotiation. They do a disservice by implying that a knowledge of Chinese classical literature will adequately prepare one for the intense experience of selling to (or buying from) the Chinese and they tend to ignore one essential fact about the central Chinese experience of the last 60 years: the Communist Revolution and the enigma of Chairman Mao Ze Dong.</p><p>In <i>The Mao of Business</i>, Levenda reveals the secrets of the day-to-day negotiations, project identification, financing, distribution, the ubiquitous sales agent, and the inescapable business banquet in China-that beautiful but occasionally hostile environment. Since 1984 Levenda has traveled continuously to China and has visited every province (except Tibet) in the search for profitable business relationships.

Once out of her cradle, she showed a marked talent for pyrotechnics, even inventing her own fireworks with names like Tumbling Demons and Shimmering Coins. Nevertheless, when Lila tells her father she'd like to become a master firework-maker, he's shocked. Firework-making is no job for a girl, he tells her; besides, with her burned fingers and singed eyebrows, he's afraid he'll never be able to find a husband for her.</p><p> If Lalchand is horrified by Lila's ambitions, his daughter is equally appalled by the prospect of a husband. Instead, she decides to run away to Mount Merapi, where every firework-maker must go to claim some of the royal sulphur from Razvani the Fire-Fiend. Lila's adventures on the road to Merapi alternate with those of her best friend, Chulak, and his talking white elephant, Hamlet, who set out after her when they learn something that could mean life or death for Lila. Along the way, they meet pirates, wild animals, and supernatural beings of every stripe until, at last, Lila must face the scariest obstacle of all: her own fear. Pullman invests <i>The Firework-Maker's Daughter</i> with wit, wonder, and more than a few goose bumps. The charm of the prose is reflected in the black and white illustrations by S. Saelig Gallagher that punctuate this slim novel. Though not as sophisticated as Pullman's remarkable fantasy novels <i>The Golden Compass</i> and <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, this engaging story <i>does</i> share a courageous heroine, an exciting adventure, and a singular philosophy that ties everything together in a deeply satisfying denouement. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Lila has learned from her father almost all there is to know about making fireworks. But he's held back the final secret, the most dangerous one. With the help of her friend Chulak, Lila discovers the secret -- that anyone who wants to be a true firework-maker must face down the Fire-Fiend of Mount Merapi and bring back some of the royal sulphur. So Lila sets off, ready to face anything that gets in her way.<p>It is only after Lila has gone that Chulak discovers the other half of the secret -- that Lila needs a flask of magic water from the Goddess of Emerald Lake or she will perish in the flames. So Chulak and Hamlet, the talking white elephant, set off to find Lila -- before it's too late....</p></p><h2>Tracker Manual: A practical guide to animal tracking in southern Africa</h2><p>This practical guide to animal tracking is a one-of-its-kind manual, based on<br>information developed with the help of southern Africa&#x2019;s few remaining traditional<br>trackers and their centuries-old wisdom in the fi eld.<br>It presents the more concrete and obvious wildlife signs for some 160 animals<br>and teams them with a host of seemingly unrelated details to give a comprehensive<br>picture of recent &#x2013; and not-so-recent &#x2013; traffi c through the bush.<br>Simple, bulleted text guides readers through the key points and teaches the<br>broad-based observational skills required to detect and interpret messages; multiple<br>photographs, some annotated, along with accurate track drawings for all the animals,<br>offer a clear visual guide too.<br>Rich in detail, accurate, and with an instructive introduction, this guide to the<br>region&#x2019;s animal tracks and signs is every tracker&#x2019;s go-to manual.</p><p>Alex van den Heever is a founder member and general manager of the Tracker Academy.

In 1773, in fact, there were none in Kentucky, though several dozen illegal surveys were made by unauthorized Virginians. Two of these were later validated by the mother colony, but then they were escheated by the state.</p> <p>The first official surveys west of the Appalachian mountains were made in 1774 by those who accompanied John Floyd, Deputy Surveyor of Fincastle County, Virginia. These men surveyed 206,000 acres, most of it in the choice region of central Kentucky, as payment for men who served the King during the French and Indian War. John Floyd, age 24, was their leader, and he directed three other licensed surveyors, including Hancock Taylor, who was killed by Indians on the Kentucky River during the summer of 1774.</p> <p>From the beginning of the Revolutionary War in 1775 until the mid-1790s, the trans-Appalachian frontier was a contested battleground in which raids and skirmishes of small parties over armies became the preferred modes of warfare.</p> <p>As a surveyor and civic leader in the settlement near the Falls, Floyd survived nine years during this hazardous period in Kentucky's early history. During this time, Floyd carried on continuous correspondence with officials and other influential persons, many of whom were his friends.

But the great promise of &#x201c;Change We Can Believe In&#x201d; was immediately tested by the threat of another&nbsp;Great Depression, a worsening war in Afghanistan, and an entrenched and deeply partisan system of business as usual in Washington. Despite all the coverage, the backstory of Obama&#x2019;s historic first year in office has until now remained a mystery.<br><br>In <i>The Promise: President Obama, Year One</i>, Jonathan Alter, one of the country&#x2019;s most respected journalists and historians, uses his unique access to the White House to produce the first inside look at Obama&#x2019;s difficult debut. <br><br>What happened in 2009 inside the Oval Office? What worked and what failed? What is the president really like on the job and off-hours, using what his best friend called &#x201c;a Rubik&#x2019;s Cube in his brain?" These questions are answered here for the first time. We see how a surprisingly cunning Obama took effective charge in Washington several weeks before his election, made trillion-dollar decisions on the stimulus and budget before he was inaugurated, engineered colossally unpopular bailouts of the banking and auto sectors, and escalated a treacherous war not long after settling into office. <br><br><i>The Promise </i>is a fast-paced and incisive narrative of a young risk-taking president carving his own path amid sky-high expectations and surging joblessness. Alter reveals that it was Obama alone&#x2014;&#x201c;feeling lucky&#x201d;&#x2014;who insisted on pushing major health care reform over the objections of his vice president and top advisors, including his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who admitted that &#x201c;I begged him not to do this.&#x201d;<br><br>Alter takes the reader inside the room as Obama prevents a fistfight involving a congressman, coldly reprimands the military brass for insubordination, crashes the key meeting at the Copenhagen Climate Change conference, and bounces back after a disastrous&nbsp;Massachusetts&nbsp;election to redeem a promise that had eluded presidents since FDR.<br><br>In Alter&#x2019;s telling, the real Obama is an authentic, demanding, unsentimental, and sometimes overconfident leader. He adapted to the presidency with ease and put more &#x201c;points on the board&#x201d; than he is given credit for, but neglected to use his leverage over the banks and failed to connect well with an angry public. We see the famously calm president cursing leaks, playfully trash-talking his advisors, and joking about even the most taboo subjects, still intent on redeeming more of his promise as the problems mount.<br><br>This brilliant blend of journalism and history offers the freshest reporting and most acute perspective on the biggest story of our time. It will shape impressions of the Obama presidency and of the man himself for years to come.</p><p>Jonathan Alter is an analyst&nbsp;and contributing correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC. He is a&nbsp;former senior editor and columnist for <i>Newsweek</i>, where he worked for twenty-eight years, writing more&nbsp;than fifty cover stories. He has also written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and other publications.&nbsp;He is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Promise: President Obama, Year One</i> and <i>The Defining Moment: FDR&#x2019;s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope</i>, both <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, and <i>Between the Lines</i>, a collection of his <i>Newsweek </i>columns.As both a political history and an in-depth biography, this book is an important first draft in assessing the Obama presidency. Many other writings will follow this one, but they will have a hard time matching the energy and reporting quality that the author brings to this work. It would be nice to say that Jonathan Alter is as effective a narrator as he is an author, but that&#39;s not the case. Alter&#39;s scratchy, hoarse voice is more of a distraction than an attribute. He reads his own words well, but that&#39;s all he does. There&#39;s little emotion in his voice, and he doesn&#39;t do justice to the charismatic man he&#39;s written about.

Contributors include philosophers, geographers, architects, and psychologists, who use a phenomenological approach to explore such themes as environmental experience, sense of place, architecture as at-homeness, and environmental design as place making. Chapters in the first section discuss the theoretical horizons of a phenomenology of environment. Following sections consider how the bodily, cultural, and symbolic aspects of architecture, landscape, and place contribute to the human experience of dwelling. The discussion provides innovative approaches to the person-environment relationship not often found in conventional environmental and design professions, as well as to scholars and laypersons who seek a new way to understand and improve people&#39;s relationships with natural and built environments.</p><p></p><h2>Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared: The New Translation by Michael Hofmann</h2><p><p><strong>Newly restored to the original text: Franz Kafka's <em>Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared</em> at last has the translator it deserves.</strong></p> Michael Hofmann's startlingly visceral and immediate translation revives Kafka's great comedy, and captures a new Kafka, free from Prague and loose in the new world, a Kafka shot through with light in this highly charged and enormously nuanced translation. Kafka began the first of his three novels in 1911, but like the others, <em>Amerika</em> remained unfinished, and perhaps, as Klaus Mann suggested, "necessarily endless." Karl Rossman, the youthful hero of the novel, "a poor boy of seventeen," has been banished by his parents to America, following a scandal. There, with unquenchable optimism, he throws himself into adventure after misadventure, and experiences multiply as he makes his way into the heart of the country, to The Great Nature Theater of Oklahoma. In creating this new translation, Hofmann, as he explains in his introduction, returned to the manuscript version of the book, restoring matters of substance and detail. Fragments which have never before been presented in English are now reinstated including the book's original "ending."</p><p><p>The poet Michael Hofmann has won numerous prizes for his German translations.</p><p><strong>Franz Kafka</strong> (1883&#x2013;1924) was one of the most important writers of the twentieth century.

She lives in the Pacific Northwest. www.cynthiarylant.com.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 1-3-In this fourth book about the two seniors who are special friends, Mr. Putter dreams about the many ways he will use his ripe tomatoes, apples-and especially pears. But when he tries to climb the ladder to pick the green edibles, his cranky legs force him to stay on the ground. Remembering his younger days, he makes himself a slingshot and uses fallen apples as ammunition. Unfortunately, he is unable to hit his targets. But what fun to sling those apples and watch them go "...over the tree, over the chimney, over the house." The next day, he and his old cat Tabby feel sorry for themselves until their neighbor, Mrs. Teaberry, arrives with her dog and a feast of apple turnovers, pies, jelly, and cider. Mr. Putter then decides what to do about the pears-just wait for them to fall. Rylant's originality continues in this autumnal adventure. She uses repetition to reinforce vocabulary development and word recognition; however, she also uses both simple and compound sentences, dialogue, and expressive language so that the story is neither stilted nor boring.

Although she hadn't been here in over twenty years, Dublin looked so familiar: the lovely Georgian townhouses with their fanlights and brightly painted doors, stone bridges arching over the River Liffey, the columned facades of imposing government buildings.<br><br>"Well, look at that," Tom said, leaning across the seat to point at the cozy brick bar with hot pink petunias spilling from glossy black window boxes. "O'Malley's Pub. It's still here. Remember? Our own personal Tir na Nog. That's where . . ."<br><br>"Some things never change," she said quickly, to stop his words. "I wonder if Mr. O'Malley is still behind the bar."<br><br>"I wonder what he'd think to see Bernie Sullivan in a nun's habit."<br><br>"With the convent right around the corner, I doubt he's shocked by the sight of a nun."<br><br>"No," Tom said. "But then, you're not just any nun."<br><br>"Tom Kelly," she said sternly. "We're either going to do this the hard way or the easy way. I'm voting for the easy way."<br><br>"You're the boss, Sister Bernadette," he said. "You always have been."<br><br>She nodded once, hard. He was right about that: she was his employer. Tom was the foreman and groundskeeper at Star of the Sea Academy in Black Hall, Connecticut, where Bernadette was Superior. He and his crew kept the lawns manicured, the gardens blooming, the vineyard producing, and the old stone walls and buildings from falling apart. He had quite a vested interest in the place; it had once been the mansion and grounds of his paternal great-grandfather, the well-known industrialist and philanthropist Francis X. Kelly.<br><br>Bernadette slid a glance across the seat, saw Tom staring out the cab window. She tried to read his expression. She had known him forever, or at least most of their lives. They had met at Star of the Sea, at summer picnics when his family would invite hers down to the beach for the day. Francis X. Kelly had employed her great-grandfather, Cormac Sullivan, to build all the walls on the property. Their families had long histories, and so did Bernadette and Tom.<br><br>Tom had thrown away his family riches to work the land. He was passionate about social causes and justice, caught up in the legacy of his ancestors' poverty, hunger, and fighting spirit. He had gone to private schools, then turned his back on a life of luxury and ease. He liked to keep his hands dirty and his feet planted solidly on the ground. Bernie loved him for it. She doubted she could have a better foreman and knew she could never have a better friend.<br><br>He looked tired, she thought. This trip was possibly more challenging for him than it was for her, and that was saying something. She knew that he had very strong hopes, in terms of the outcome. And she knew, even before they really set forth on their quest, that he would be disappointed.<br><br>"Here we are," the driver said in his bright Irish accent. "The Convent of Notre Dame des Victoires."<br><br>"Guess which one of us is staying here," Tom asked him.<br><br>"Very funny," Bernadette said as the driver chuckled.<br><br>Although the driver started to help her with her bags, Tom took over. She saw him reach into the trunk, pull out her suitcase. She rarely used it, hardly ever leaving Star of the Sea, except for the occasional monastic conference or retreat. Since her family--her brother John, his wife, Honor, and their three daughters--lived on the Academy grounds, she usually spent her week's vacation right there at home.<br><br>She had applied for a sabbatical last year, hoping to go to Florence to study her beloved Fra Angelico, but had never found the time to take it. The Academy always needed her--to run the school, make decisions in the convent, keep the vineyard operating.<br><br>This trip to Dublin fell under the category of "personal time." As Superior, she had granted time away to Sisters with sick siblings or parents, funerals to attend, family emergencies. For her own leave of absence, she had made arrangements very quickly, left Sister Ursula in charge of everything, including the hectic start of the school year. None of her nuns had ever needed to deal with anything like what she herself was about to face, and the thought of it sent chills through her body.<br><br>"Are you cold, Bernie?" Tom asked, seeing her shiver, standing on the curb.<br><br>"No," she said. "I'm fine."<br><br>"Coming down with something?"<br><br>She shook her head, gazing past him at the convent's curtained windows. She thought she saw the fabric move and a shadow pass behind the glass.<br><br>"Well, I'll be at the house," he said. "You have my number if you need me. If they don't have orange juice, or you need some aspirin or something, you know who to call."<br><br>"I'm sure they'll have everything I need," she said dryly, slipping her hands into her sleeves.<br><br>"And if they don't, you'll get it," he said. "You do know how to take care of things, I'll give you that." He squinted up at the convent, as if assessing the brickwork. "There's some crumbling mortar there, needs repointing," he said, pointing at the front steps. It was probably a very effective way to block out his memory of the last time he'd dropped her off at this address.<br><br>"Not every convent can be lucky enough to have you on staff," she said.<br><br>He gazed down at her, the squint not letting up one bit. She waited for a smile, but it didn't come. What did she expect? For him to thank her for the compliment? Not likely, not Tom Kelly. Under the circumstances, it probably sounded to him meager at best.<br><br>"At least, most likely, they don't have a resident vandal," he said, giving her a quick, mischievous smile. "What was that message, carved in the stone?" He paused, seeming to think, even though she was sure he knew the words by heart. She felt the heat in her neck and face, and she shook her head. She never would have expected Tom to be so mean. "Tell me the words, Bernie. The ones that appeared first, early in the summer . . ."<br><br>" 'I was sleeping, but my heart kept vigil,' " she murmured.<br><br>He nodded. "That's right," he said, lifting her bag, carrying it up the sidewalk. "How could I forget?"<br><br>"You didn't," she said coolly, unlatching the wrought-iron gate at the foot of the front steps.<br><br>As they climbed the steps, she felt years falling away, almost as if she were coming to the convent for the first time, preparing to join the order. Her mouth was dry, and she was filled with a sense of trepidation, fear that she might be making the wrong choice.<br><br>"You sure you want to do this?" Tom asked, the same question he'd put to her twenty-three years earlier.<br><br>"The choice has already been made," Bernie said, echoing her own response.<br><br>Just then the door opened, and a nun stood there smiling widely, gazing at Bernie with warm green-gold eyes. She was tall and thin, and looked exactly as Bernie remembered her, all those years ago, when they were novices together.<br><br>"Sister Bernadette Ignatius!" the nun said in her Kerry brogue.<br><br>"Sister Anne-Marie," Bernie said.<br><br>Tom slid the bag into the front hall, standing back as the old friends embraced and Bernie wiped away tears.<br><br>"Is that you, Tom Kelly?" Sister Anne-Marie asked, beaming.<br><br>"It sure is," he said. "How're you doing, Annie?"<br><br>"I'm fine," she said, throwing herself against him in a big hug. Bernie watched the affection in both their faces, and she fought to keep her own expression as blank as possible. She knew this wasn't going to be simple, and she had to maintain as much control as she could.<br><br>"Okay, I'm off," Tom said. "You have my number, Sister Bernadette. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Take good care of her, Sister Anne-Marie."<br><br>"You know I will," she said with mock sternness, locking arms with Bernie, and pulling her into the inner sanctum, closing the door behind her.<br><br>Bernie's heart was pounding. She looked around the hall, saw the delicate marble statue of the Blessed Mother standing in the alcove. The aroma of good cooking wafted down the hall, and she also smelled hints of incense from the chapel just off the front hall. Memories were flooding back, making her feel almost faint. She heard the car door slam, and when she glanced past the curtain, she saw Tom watching out the car window as the driver pulled away.<br><br>"Feels like it's happening all over again," she said in a low voice.<br><br>"It's not, though," Sister Anne-Marie replied, standing just behind her.<br><br>"I'm not sure why I came," Bernie said. "This story has already been written. Right down to 'The End.' "<br><br>"A kinder way to look at it," Sister Anne-Marie said gently, her tone bringing hot tears to Bernie's eyes as she eased her around, taking her hand, "is that the story is just beginning. 'Once upon a time . . .' "<br><br>Bernie opened her mouth to reply, but just then she heard heavy footsteps coming through the parlor--the room where she had seen the shadow behind the curtain. And she knew without turning around that this was the person she dreaded seeing more than anyone in this world.<br><br>Merrion Square was one of Dublin's finest addresses, hands down, and it was there that Tom Kelly directed the driver to take him. The large Georgian square was surrounded by museums and brick townhouses with wrought-iron balconies, ivy growing up the bric...</p><h2>Crusades: The Illustrated History</h2><p>This richly illustrated history of the crusades comprises specialist contributions by some familiar names in crusader studies.

Nowhere is Blake's glorious poetic and pictorial legacy more evident than in this monumental study of his illuminated poems.<br>Compiled and annotated by one of the world's foremost Blake scholars, the book's original publication represented the first working edition of the entire illuminated canon. Accompanied by David V. Erdman's erudite and penetrating analysis, the meticulously reproduced plates reveal the poet/artist's singular attempt to achieve the perfect union of painting and poetry. Commenting on such Blakean masterpieces as <i>The Book of Thel, Songs of Innocence and of Experience, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, The Song of Los, The Book of Urizen</i>, and other works, Professor Erdman discusses the details of each illustration in the context of the poem it accompanies. All but the largest plates are reproduced in their original sizes.<br>A comprehensive study revealing the lyrical beauty and intricate design of Blake's illuminated works. This inexpensive edition is required reading &#x2014; and viewing &#x2014; for students and scholars of Blake.</p><p></p><h2>The seventh son;: The thought and writings of W. E. B. Du Bois</h2><p>two books, vol 1 and 2 at the price of one.</p><p></p><h2>That We May Be Mutually Encouraged: Feminism and the New Perspective in Pauline Studies</h2><p><p>There has been a revolutionary shift of thinking in Pauline Studies, fundamentally changing the image of Paul. Postmodern literary criticism of Paul's epistles and sociorhetorical criticism of his letters has created a New Perspective approach to Pauline studies. At the same time, feminist criticism of the Pauline corpus has been growing. Unfortunately there has been hardly any interaction and exchange of research results between these different strands of scholarship. The result of this is that in Pauline studies scholars are hardly aware of feminist perspectives. Similarly, feminist interpretations of Paul, not fully conversant with the most recent strands of Pauline research, are often based on traditional images of Paul. </p><p>Ehrensperger's analysis of feminist commentaries on Paul thus contains a rather negative depiction of theological thinking. However, both strands of research, feminist and those of the New Perspective, provide fresh and illuminating insights that emphasize similar aspects from different perspectives.</p><p>Ehrensperger advocates a closer interaction between these two schools of Pauline studies. She analyzes Romans 14-15, exploring the results of recent research in both Pauline schools. Pauline studies from the New Perspective emphasize the Jewish context and texture of Paul's thinking. She sets these in dialogue with feminist theology, which focuses on issues of identity, diversity, and relationality. Her study results in a perspective on Paul which views him as a significant dialogue partner in the search for a theology beyond anti-Semitism and misogyny, beyond force and domination.</p><p>Kathy Ehrensperger studied theology at the Universities of Basel and Berne, and was a pastor for sixteen years in Switzerland. She is currently a Lecturer in New Testament Studies at the University of Wales, Lampeter.</p></p><p>Dr. Kathy Ehrensperger is Senior Lecturer in New Testament Studies, University of Wales, Lampeter, UK."Much discrete advances have been made in feminist biblical studies, in 'New Perspective' Pauline studies, and in post-Shoah theology.

It all begins one fateful evening when young Kate steps on a freshly dug grave. She is powerless to refuse when an unearthly voice commands her to dig up his coffin...but the worst is yet to come. How can Kate free herself from the evil spirit and save the life of the one she loves? <br>One of America's most beloved painters of fantasy presents a rousing ghost story for older picture book readers, perfect for campfires, sleepovers, and Halloween storytelling.</p><p>Michael Hague has illustrated more than twenty children&#39;s classics, including lavish editions of A Wind in the Willows Christmas , The Wizard of Ox , and Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland . He lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Gr 4 Up-Kate outwits a ghost and her own ill-fortune in this retelling of a traditional Irish tale set in the mid-1800s. After she steps on a newly filled grave, the dead man forces her to care for him by preparing oatmeal mixed with freshly drawn human blood. By pretending to eat her share while secreting it away in her scarf, she provides the means of reviving the young men whose blood she has drawn. Subsequent quick thinking on her part secures a rosy future for herself. The watercolor illustrations draw on the dark end of Hague's usual earth-tone palette and depict a desolate village and eerie graveyard. The dead man's ragged clothing, clawlike hands, and gaunt face match the text for spine-tingling appeal. As in the best folktales, the telling retains a consistent sense of time and place in both the text and the illustrations. A note names Jeremiah Curtin as the tale's original collector. Other less lyrical versions include "Mary Culhane and the Dead Man" in Molly Bang's The Goblins Giggle and Other Stories (Peter Smith, 1988) and Robert San Souci's "The Blood-Drawing Ghost" in Even More Short and Shivery (Delacorte, 1997). From the haunting endpapers on, this fluidly retold and memorably illustrated tale is perfect scary-story fare for middle-grade programming.<p></p><p><i>Faith Brauti-gam, Gail Borden Public Library, Elgin, IL</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>One Dark Throne (Three Dark Crowns) [Paperback]</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p>In the sequel to the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>Three Dark Crowns</em>, which of the three sisters will prevail?</p><p>With the shocking events of the Quickening behind them and the Ascension Year underway, war is in the air for the three queens.

A NATURAL WOMAN chronicles King&#39;s extraordinary life, drawing readers into her musical world, including her phenomenally successful #1 album Tapestry, and into her journey as a performer, mother, wife and present-day activist. Deeply personal, King&#39;s long-awaited memoir offers readers a front-row seat to the woman behind the legend. The book will include dozens of photos from King&#39;s childhood, her own family, and behind-the-scenes images from her performances.</p><p>Carole King had her first No. 1 hit in 1961, at age 18, with "Will You Love Me Tomorrow". Collaborating with former husband Gerry Goffin, the team went on to write more than two dozen chart-toppers, including "One Fine Day", "The Loco-Motion", "Will You Love Me Tomorrow", and "(You Me Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman." Her 1971 solo-album, <i>Tapesty</i>, won 4 Grammys, and earned her the record for longest time an album by a female artist has remained on the Billboard Charts (6 years), as well as the longest time holding the #1 position (15 consecutive weeks).<br><br>King, in addition to writing more than 100 top-selling songs has recorded 25 solo albums. In 2007 she and longtime collaborator James Taylor reunited and recorded <i>Live at the Troubadour. </i>Released in 2010 the album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and <i>The Troubadour Reunion Tour </i>became the second highest grossing Tour of that year. She has won numerous lifetime achievement honors and has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, "Hit Parade" Hall of Fame, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br><br>Carole King continues to entertain audiences the world over. She released her most recent album in December, 2011, <i>Carole King: A Holiday Carole</i>, to rave reviews.Weaving a tapestry of rich and royal hue, King's affecting memoir eases readers through her life, from the girlhood in Brooklyn where she was already jotting down lyrics and her teenage years that culminated musically with the hit "Will You Love Me Tomorrow?"; through her tumultuous marriage and songwriting years with her first husband, Gerry Goffin; her moves back and forth between New York and California; her three marriages after Goffin; and her deep commitment to environmental issues bred by her living self-sufficiently with her family in the mountains of Idaho. She confronts the physical abuse she experienced at the hands of her third husband; her disbelief that she would let someone treat her that way, and her incredulousness at her own decision to remain in the relationship; and her eventual decision-with the help of an abuse support group-to leave him. King's passionate engagement with all kinds of music, and her musical genius (her Tapestry album remained on the charts for six years running, a distinction that eluded even the Beatles) flood through these reflections, and she recreates the excitement of working with producers such as Lou Adler, Jerry Wexler, and Ahmet Ertegun, musicians James Taylor, Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Aretha Franklin, and songwriters Neil Sedaka, Cynthia Weil, and Barry Mann, among many others.&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>An acclaimed singer-songwriter invites fans into her personal life.<br>When King embarked on her Living Room Tour in 2004, she re-created onstage the atmosphere that millions had come to expect from the slew of albums she recorded from the 1970s onward. <em>Tapestry</em>, her breakthrough 1971 album, not only became a bestseller and a benchmark for women's achievements in the music industry but also introduced the down-to-earth, optimistic and liberated worldview of a woman with some timely stories to tell. King's trajectory mirrored that of many of her fellow musical peers. Bitten by the music bug at an early age and subsequently converted to rock 'n' roll in the '50s, she began writing her own songs, landing a record deal at the age of 15. She would experience far greater success, however, when she and co-songwriter Gerry Goffin turned out hit after hit for such artists as Aretha Franklin, the Shirelles and the Monkees. Having married Goffin when she was 17, King spent most of the '60s balancing her career with her responsibilities as a wife and mother. Change was in the air, though, and when her marriage deteriorated, she set off for Los Angeles to seek her own voice. That voice comes through strongly on every page of this memoir, an engaging assortment of recollections comprising a journey that started in her working-class Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, took her to Manhattan and Laurel Canyon and saw her escape what Joni Mitchell called "the star maker machinery" to settle in rural Idaho. In one of the book's best sections, King explains her decision to retreat from fame in the mid '70s, chronicling the joys and sorrows of going "back to the land" as well as the tempestuous relationships she had with two men during this period. She is also refreshingly candid about her four marriages.<br><br>A warm, winning read that showcases baby-boomer culture at its best.&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></i></b></p><h2>John: That You May Believe (Living Word Bible Studies) (Living World Bible Studies)</h2><p>John may be the most artful and poetic of the gospels; it demands and rewards study of its literary shape, the power of its metaphors (e.g., the <i>I am</i>s), Jesus' deep discourses, and the beauty of his unfolding passion throughout its chapters. Jesus, the Word made flesh, emerges powerfully and personally, so it is no surprise that John sums up his gospel's message as "so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:31). John offers a theologically deep answer and a compelling historical narrative as to the identity and purpose of God's anointed Son.</p><p>A native of St. Louis, Missouri, <b>Kathleen Nielson</b> holds M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in literature from Vanderbilt University and a B.A. from Wheaton College (Illinois).

The images, chosen by the photographers themselves, demonstrate how, during the early 1990s, British photographers, stylists and art directors ruptured the style of fashion photography, by using ordinary domestic locations, second-hand clothing and unconventional looking models. Quickly labelled "grunge photography", this became the new fashion imagery of the decade. The illustrations show how the distinctions between editorial and advertising, photography and fine art and commercial styles became blurred while the growth in the number of magazines and the rise of the internet increased the scope and availability of fashion imagery. Through interviews and photographs, a style of photography emerges which has a harder edge and challenges previously accepted stereotypes of fashion and glamour.</p><p></p><h2>The Whitechapel Conspiracy (Thomas Pitt, Book 21)</h2><p>For readers everywhere, the arrival of a new novel featuring Superintendent Thomas Pitt and his wife, Charlotte, is cause for rejoicing&#x2013;an occasion to bask once again in the matchless panorama of life in Victorian England, where gaslight gleams on cobblestones and silver spoons clink gently on fine china; where honor and shame keep close company; where the end is sometimes used to justify the most murderous means. <b>The Whitechapel Conspiracy</b> is the series masterpiece, based on real events that shock us today as much as they chilled Londoners more than a century ago.<br><br>It is spring, 1892. Queen Victoria persists in her life of self-absorbed seclusion. The Prince of Wales outrages decent people with his mistresses and profligate ways. The grisly killings of Whitechapel prostitutes by a man dubbed Jack the Ripper remain a frightening enigma. And in a packed Old Bailey courtroom, distinguished soldier John Adinett is sentenced to hang for the inexplicable murder of his friend, Martin Fetters.<br><br>Though Thomas Pitt should receive praise for providing key testimony in the Fetters investigation, Adinett&#x2019;s powerful friends of the secretive Inner Circle make sure he is vilified instead. Thus Pitt is suddenly relieved of his Bow Street command and reassigned to the clandestine Special Branch in the dangerous East End. There he must investigate alleged anarchist plots, working undercover and living, far from his family, in Whitechapel, one of the area&#x2019;s worst slums. His allies are few&#x2013;among them clever Charlotte and intrepid Gracie, the maid who knows the neighborhood and can maneuver it without raising eyebrows. But neither of them anticipates the horrors soon to be revealed.<br><br><b>The Whitechapel Conspiracy</b> resonates from the degraded depths of the East End to the seats of the mighty. Anne Perry weaves history into a rich and seamless tapestry of suspense. <br></p><p>After a less-than-impressive outing with the more-turgid-than-tense <i>Half Moon Street</i>, Anne Perry is back on familiar--and entertaining-- turf with <i>The Whitechapel Conspiracy</i>. As if apologizing for their last efforts, the whole Victorian crew seems thankfully less concerned with respecting social mores than with ratcheting up the pressure in a nicely paced political-conspiracy potboiler. <p> For Inspector Thomas Pitt, doing one's job can have unpleasant consequences. When his testimony sends distinguished soldier John Adinett to the gallows for the murder of Martin Fetters, traveler and antiquarian, Adinett's friends (members of the Inner Circle, "those men who had secret loyalties which superseded every other honor or pledge") ensure that Pitt loses his command of the Bow Street station. He is forced to leave his family and take up an undercover existence in the slum district of Spitalfields, chasing anarchists (though he feels he might as well be chasing his own tail). But when his wife, Charlotte, their maid, Gracie, and her would-be suitor, Sergeant Tellman, apply themselves to the task of restoring Pitt's good name, they uncover an anarchist's conspiracy that dwarfs even Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot. The secrets and lies of respected men lurking in the halls of power, who will stop at nothing short of abolishing the monarchy, form the backdrop for the trio's frantic investigations. To top everything off, Perry throws in a marvelously effective subplot--but to divulge how Jack the Ripper figures into the narrative would be to spoil a highly entertaining read.</p><p> The novel has its flaws; Charlotte's great-aunt Vespasia seems less the dynamic character she has been throughout the series than a mouthpiece of mourning for the waves of change. Yes, the reader is tempted to say, the potential downfall of the British monarchy would no doubt be painful and unspeakably unsettling for those who respect Victoria and her forebears--but must one natter endlessly on about it? Better to let the whole shebang go gracefully into that good night. No fears for contemporary Victorian-philes, though; with Thomas and Charlotte around, who could doubt that the monarchy will live to fight another day? <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>&#x201c;A CHILLING WALK THROUGH HISTORY . . .If ever there was a place that could fuel a revolution, it was the streets around Whitechapel.

Otherwise, you'll get more than a glimpse of what is to come...</i></p> <p>To any reader of the Dark Tower series, Roland Deschain is an instantly recognizable character. As I write this, I see him in my mind's eye, striding across the yellowing grasses of the River Barony savannah, his black hair threaded with gray, his body tall and lanky, his holster and gun belt strapped to his hips. Only one of those fabled sandalwood-handled six-shooters is with him; it rests against his left thigh. The other is back at camp, secure in the docker's clutch strapped to Eddie Dean's side. As I stare, Roland turns his head and regards me pragmatically. <i>If you need to talk to me,</i> he says, <i>then come.</i> Time may be a face on the water, but in Roland's world, water is scarce.</p> <p>Roland watches as I pass through the doorway of the page. His pale blue eyes really are like those of a bombardier, both cool and assessing. By necessity, this meeting will be brief. I'm another one of Roland's secrets, and he thinks it better to keep me that way. He's not certain what level of the Tower I come from, but he knows one thing. I am mapping his travels.</p> <p>Finding some shade, Roland hunkers. I hand him one of the rolling papers I've brought, and he accepts it silently. Unlacing the leather thongs of his traveling purse, he removes his tobacco poke and rolls a smoke. Despite the missing fingers on his right hand, he works the paper dexterously, licking the gummed side with a grimace. He strikes a match against the seam of his jeans and lights his cigarette. For a moment his face is illuminated with an eerie glow that makes his features look drawn and more than a little haggard. He has a few days' worth of stubble on his cheeks, and his lips are chapped. Once again I try to show him this concordance, but he waves the bound manuscript away as he exhales a cloud of smoke. As always, he thinks that my constant revisions waste paper. Besides, he's only interested in the maps. But today I've brought a short piece, and this he has agreed to hear. It's my interpretation of his epic journey. Taking another deep drag, Roland rolls his hand in that gesture which means only one thing, in any world. <i>Get on with it.</i> So I clear my throat and (rather nervously) begin.</p> <p></p> Roland, the Tower, and the Quest <p>Roland Deschain is Mid-World's final gunslinger. Like a knight from the Arthurian legends of our world, Roland is on a quest. His "grail" is the Dark Tower, the linchpin of the Time/Space continuum, and his goal is to climb to its very top and question the god or demon who resides there. Roland's world is unraveling. The Beams that maintain the proper alignment of time, space, size and dimension are breaking down and the Tower itself is foundering. This structural instability affects all worlds, but in Roland's, the symptoms are dramatic. As the fabric of reality wears away, thinnies form and spread. These squalling mist bogs swallow all those that stumble into them, letting their captives fall into the dark no-places between worlds. As the landscape stretches, directions drift. What is west today may be southwest tomorrow and southeast the day after. A goal that lay only fifty miles away can suddenly become a hundred, or even a thousand miles distant.</p> <p>As the direct descendant of Arthur Eld, King of All-World-That-Was, and as Mid-World's last <i>dinh,</i> Roland must rescue his land from annihilation. But his task is gargantuan. He must find a way to safeguard the framework, the loom, upon which the interpenetrating realities are woven. But in order to do so -- in order to shore up that central Tower and the Beams which radiate out from it -- he must find his way across a landscape so fragmented that neither map nor memory can help him pinpoint his destination. In fact, Roland does not even know where the Tower stands. He realizes that he must head toward a place called End-World, but where does that land lie? How can he find it? During the early stages of his journey, Roland the warrior chooses the path of the ascetic. Believing he can only reach his goal as a solitary traveler, he sacrifices all human relationships, even when it means betrayal, because he thinks such sacrifice will speed him along his way. Comrades and lovers are left behind like abandoned waterskins.</p> <p>Roland believes that to climb the Tower he must have no ties holding him to Mid-World. He must be isolated, self-sufficient, cut off from the nurturing tides of relationship. Thinking in terms of conquest and battle, Roland follows the duplicitous Walter across the deserts of Mid-World, believing that this enemy will eventually lead him to his goal. Similarly, as a boy, he followed the path set for him by Maerlyn's Grapefruit, a magic ball whose evil, distorting visions tricked him into first sacrificing his lover, Susan Delgado, and then murdering his own mother.</p> <p>What Roland doesn't at first realize is that, like any young knight, he is being tested. The initial path he chooses is a false start, no more than a <i>glammer</i> thrown by the enemies who want to thwart him. What their treachery exposes is that the young Roland is driven by ambition, personal glory, and revenge as much as he is by a desire to fulfill his destiny as the last warrior of the White. By tempting him to betray all that a knight should hold sacred, Roland's enemies ensure that Roland will repeat the mistakes of his fathers and either abandon his quest as hopeless or become lost in the deserts and golgothas of Mid-World which, in the end, but mirror the dry wreckage of his heart.</p> <p>Roland, the young warrior, does not understand the ultimate nature of his quest. He does not realize that, as the trickster Walter says in the golgotha, he already stands so close to the Tower that worlds turn about his head. Because of his own preconceptions, his inherited worldview, he does not understand that his fate, and the fate of Mid-World, are one and the same.</p> <p>Roland's story is not just an adventure tale; it is one with symbolic meaning. His pilgrimage is intrinsically linked to a legend from our world, a legend which was an important influence upon the Modernists and which formed the basis for a famous poem by T. S. Eliot. That legend is the story of the Waste Land. In its incarnation in the Dark Tower series, this legend is bound to another belief, one that dates back to the time when men and women thought that their kings and queens were appointed by God. According to this worldview, the body of the king is the body of the land, and the well-being of one is indivisible from the well-being of the other. If the king is sick, in body or in mind, then the land falls to ruin. To cure the land, you must first cure the king. The one will only flourish if the other is in balance.</p> <p>As above, so below. The disease of the larger is the same as that of the smaller, and they both progress according to the same principle. To understand what dries and devastates the land, what threatens the very fabric of the universe and the stability of the interpenetrating worlds, one must also understand what ails the king. All are affected by the same illness, but to cure this illness we must discover its underlying cause. And this is the true purpose of Roland's journey.</p> <p>We all know that as the Beams snap, the Tower falters. But what is its equivalent on the human plane? What malaise weakens the bonds of Mid-World's culture? What disease affects Roland, the foremost representative of his fragmenting world?</p> <p>High Speech, the tongue of gunslingers, is a subtle and complex language. Its words are difficult to define because they are so full of nuance. Each word has multiple meanings which refer, simultaneously, to ordinary human interaction, to the web that joins the interacting individuals, and to the greater pattern of humanity's past and future movements. No human interaction, then, is meaningless. They all reflect both individual and cultural ka.</p> <p><i>Ka,</i> we know, resembles a wheel. In fact, it looks much like the wheel Roland draws in <i>The Waste Lands,</i> a wheel meant to represent The Tower, the Beams, and the Portals in and out of Mid-World. In Roland's map, the hub of the wheel is the Tower, the spokes are the Beams, and the rivets are the Guardians, who are the Portals' sentries. Some Guardians, like the Turtle, are protective, while others, like the Bear Guardian Shardik, are downright dangerous. But they all serve the Beams, the Beams serve the Tower, and the Tower is what keeps the universe united. And perhaps these Beams work like Batteries, with positive and negative charges, the one balancing the other. That would explain why the Turtle is kind and the Bear -- the opposite end of the Beam -- is negative. Even polarity has its place, like light and darkness. That is, as long as the whole remains in balance.</p> <p>Although it would be difficult to map the wheel of <i>ka</i> in this way -- it is much too big -- we can, at least, map the forces of <i>ka-tet,</i> remembering that the small is a miniature of the larger. As <i>dinh</i> of his <i>ka-tet</i> and as <i>dinh</i> of Mid-World, Roland sits at the center of the wheel. The Guardians of his present <i>ka-tet</i> are his companions Jake, Susannah, Eddie and Oy. The sorcerer Walter -- who plays a large part in the drawing and binding of this <i>ka-tet --</i> can also be placed as one of the Guardians, though his polarity is negative.</p> <p>Just as there is a word for the pattern of <i>ka-tet,</i> there is a word for the bonds (or Beams) that hold the tet together. This word is <i>khef.</i> Like almost all the words of High Speech, khef has multiple meanings, including birth and life-force, but perhaps the most ubiquitous of these meanings is also the simplest. And that meaning is water.</p> <p>As Roland knows all too well from his journey in the Mohaine Desert, a human will die much sooner from dehydration than he will from lack of food. The same can be said about the land, about ...</p></p><h2>12 Sermons on the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Spurgeon presents the work, power, presence, and glory of the Spirit in thesemessages and challenges unbelievers, Christians, and especially the church asa body.</p><p></p><h2>Into Great Silence: A Memoir of Discovery and Loss among Vanishing Orcas</h2><p><b>Science entwines with matters of the human heart as a whale researcher chronicles the lives of an endangered family of orcas</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since Eva Saulitis began her whale research in Alaska in the 1980s, she has been drawn deeply into the lives of a single extended family of endangered orcas struggling to survive in Prince William Sound.&nbsp;Over the course of&nbsp;a decades-long career spent observing and studying these whales, and eventually coming to know them as individuals, she has, sadly, witnessed the devastation wrought by the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989&#x2014;after which not a single calf has been born to the group.

Merwin, from &#x201c;The Last One&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I knew there was such thing as a species, much less one that was endangered, I understood extinction.&nbsp; When I was nine years old, I understood extinction not with my mind, but with my heart.&nbsp; Aptly, I received this instruction not at school, but after, on an ABC After School Special called <i>The Last of the Curlews</i>, based on a novel by Fred Bodsworth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t remember the film&#x2019;s plot.&nbsp; Only that at some point, there was one pair of curlews left.&nbsp; I vaguely remember a father and son who debated whether or not to shoot a curlew.&nbsp; I recall with clarity the last one, the last Eskimo curlew on earth, circling and calling above the tundra.&nbsp; In the bird&#x2019;s own memory, I imagined a sky darkened and drummed to life by bodies, wings and the <i>tr tr tr</i>-ing of flight-song, an era when it migrated between the Canadian Arctic and Patagonia with millions of other Eskimo curlews. I can still summon my ache for that last curlew; almost 40 years later, it throbs in my chest. <br><br>When I was 23, I saw my first orca, a lone female.&nbsp; That day, I had no inkling that I would study her kin for my entire adult life, that she was already one of the last ones.&nbsp; Fresh out of college, I&#x2019;d taken a job at a fish hatchery in Prince William Sound, Alaska.&nbsp; One blustery winter day, out for a skiff ride, I spotted a black fin amid gray waves.&nbsp; A few minutes later, a <i>whoosh</i> near the skiff startled me.&nbsp; I turned to see a wind-flattened blow, the fin rising, the arch of a flank emerging and sliding back under the water.&nbsp; Then she disappeared, as if the rough sea had swallowed her.&nbsp; I looked everywhere, but she was gone.&nbsp; <br><br> Twenty-five years later, I&#x2019;m still searching for that whale, for what&#x2019;s left of her family.&nbsp; For me, watching the <i>Last of the Curlews</i> was what Susan Cerulean calls an &#x201c;origin moment.&#x201d;&nbsp; That day, when I realized human beings could eliminate a kind of bird from the earth, my assumptions about the world overturned. <br><br> A lifetime of origin moments leads to this one.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s September, 2011.&nbsp; I sit on our research boat, <i>Natoa</i>, scanning a familiar shoreline for orca blows.&nbsp; The tide is low.&nbsp; A raft of sea otters rests near Squire Point.&nbsp; For many seasons, I followed small groups of orcas called Chugach transients past this point as they hunted for harbor seals.&nbsp; Sometimes, harbor seals hauled out on Squire Point to rest, or hunkered in the shallows alongside the rock to hide from passing orcas.&nbsp; Though I see no seals sprawled on the rock today, I know orcas might appear at any moment.&nbsp; They are like that, unpredictable in their appearances and disappearances.&nbsp; <br><br> And so are stories we tell about them.&nbsp; Take today.&nbsp; As we idle along the point, Craig, my partner in research and in life, recalls that 35 years ago, with a cadre of volunteer observers on the bluff top on Squire Island, he watched Chugach transients swim along this shoreline.&nbsp; A young field assistant, eye pressed to the lens of a spotting scope, shouted:&nbsp; &#x201c;Look, the orcas are playing with a porpoise!&#x201d;&nbsp; That evening, after hiking back down from the bluff to their tents on a beach we still call Whale Camp, they found the severed lungs, heart and head of a porpoise calf washed up on shore.&nbsp; &#x201c;I tried to preserve the skull, but the porpoise was so young, the bones just fell apart,&#x201d; Craig says.&nbsp; With Craig, I&#x2019;ve studied orcas for 25 years, nearly half my life, and I&#x2019;ve never heard that story before.&nbsp; What I know, after all this time, about the whale called orca, <i>arlluk</i>, <i>aglu</i>, blackfish, killer whale &#x2013; is a lot like that. <br><br> Now our boat rounds the bend of Squire Island, and Whale Camp beach slides into view.&nbsp; Many times, Chugach transients swam past Whale Camp when I lived there.&nbsp; Often they startled my field assistant and me from our tasks.&nbsp; Some still pass this way.&nbsp; But it won&#x2019;t always be so.&nbsp; I force myself to write the words:&nbsp; The Chugach transients are going extinct.&nbsp; They are leaving the earth under my watch.&nbsp; There will, perhaps in my lifetime, be a last one.&nbsp; I type the words, and that old hurt I felt for the Eskimo curlew throbs.&nbsp; How do I accept the reality of that word &#x2013; extinction?&nbsp; Forty years later, do I understand with my heart, much less my head, what it means?<br> &nbsp;<br> Last summer, from an unexpected angle, I got closer to understanding the concept when I edged up to &#x2013; no, was shoved toward &#x2013; the possibility of my own extinction.&nbsp; From a sick-bed, my laptop open on my lap, cell phone on the coverlet beside me, I followed the movements of Chenega, one of the last Chugach transient matriarchs, on a computer screen.&nbsp; I stared as a digitized map of Prince William Sound drew itself, then displayed the points and lines of her night-time travels.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Off Point Helen.&nbsp; I clicked on the biggest dot, the most recent satellite hit.&nbsp; 4:30 am, heading south.&nbsp; The dots told me only that much.&nbsp; Not if she traveled alone.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d been with her companions, Iktua and Mike, when Craig had tagged her the night before.&nbsp; <br> A sea-breeze drug my eyes across the carpet, the couch, the coffee table piled with get-well cards to a window.&nbsp; There, my eyes met not the Pacific, but the Atlantic; not Prince William Sound, but Cape Cod Bay, where wind left white claw marks on the indigo surface.&nbsp; For the first time in 24 years, I was not in Prince William Sound studying orcas in summer.&nbsp; I clicked on the link to the Iridium website, typed a satellite text-message to Craig and our friend Cy, who was filling in for me on the boat. <br><br>I shut the computer, pushed it to the side of the bed, sank down against the pillows, closed my eyes.&nbsp; Before I rose to my reality, the fact that the day before, in a Boston hospital, an IV had pumped a toxic chemical into a vein on top of my left hand, the fact that I was being treated for breast cancer, and downstairs, what awaited me was a regimen of anti-nausea meds swallowed with a few baby spoons of applesauce, before I faced that I was not there, in Prince William Sound, not even near, that it was humid and hot every day where I was and not rainy and cool, before any of that, I placed myself in Knight Island Passage at dusk, off Squire Point, in the rain, on <i>Natoa</i> with Craig and Cy, and I tried to recreate the encounter Craig had described on the sat-phone the night before. How Chenega had been hunting with Iktua and Mike all afternoon, impossible to approach as transients so often are.&nbsp; How Craig and Cy had given up.&nbsp; It was late.&nbsp; The shelter of Sanctuary Bay beckoned.&nbsp; They were wet and cold and frustrated.&nbsp; How they&#x2019;d turned east, Craig taking the wheel inside the boat cabin, Cy enjoying a few minutes of solitude on the bridge, watching the hidden entrance to Sanctuary Bay reveal itself.&nbsp; How she&#x2019;d appeared beside the boat.&nbsp; How she&#x2019;d swum alongside the bow, lunging out of the water to keep up the pace.&nbsp; How Cy had stamped his foot on the cabin roof to signal Craig.&nbsp; How Craig had poked his head out, heard Cy shout,&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Chenega, right here, I think she wants you to tag her now.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br>How Craig had tagged, easily, with one shot, one of the last seven Chugach transients.&nbsp; That was why, from thousands of miles and a continent away, I could call her up each morning and see where she was.&nbsp; That&#x2019;s how I could track an animal that exemplified fidelity to place, fidelity against all odds, in sickness and in health, in peace and calamity.<br><br> I&#x2019;d been told by healers to visualize my immune system preying on cancer cells.&nbsp; I&#x2019;d been told visualization could lessen chemotherapy&#x2019;s side-effects and speed up healing.&nbsp; So I visualized.&nbsp; The animals, the place.&nbsp; I visualized kayaking into Sanctuary Bay, where Chenega, Mike and Iktua milled, waiting.&nbsp; I drifted into their midst and placed my hand on Chenega&#x2019;s fin, placed my hand on the cold, rubbery skin, knowing hot, oxygen-rich blood flowed inside, and I imagined her red and white blood cells traveling up my arm, infusing my own blood with power.<br><br>The next time Craig called, he told me he&#x2019;d photographed all of the remaining seven Chugach transients:&nbsp; Chenega, Iktua, Egagutak, Mike, Marie, Ewan, Paddy. <br> All that hot, humid summer, I sat at a desk each day I was able, or I sat with the laptop propped open on my lap in bed, and I wrote their stories.&nbsp; In doing so I understood, not just with my head, not just with my heart, but with my body, that certain places on this earth have healing power, and that the place where the Chugach transients live is one.&nbsp; I came to believe that the place and the whales played a part in rescuing me.&nbsp; Not in some mystical sense, but simply by existing, with or without me.&nbsp; They saved me, though I can&#x2019;t save them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br>Now a year has passed.&nbsp; I&#x2019;m back in Prince William Sound, back on <i>Natoa</i>, short-haired, body altered, a strange, new post-chemo ringing in my ears, one I hear only when it&#x2019;s quiet.&nbsp; But as always in August, my fingertips are blueberry-stained.&nbsp; As always, resident orcas appear in the passages to feed on silver salmon.&nbsp; As always, salmon spawn and die by the millions in streams.&nbsp; Craig douses bucketfuls of saltwater over four silver salmon he&#x2019;s caught off Whale Camp beach.&nbsp; As always, we search the shorelines for Chugach transients.&nbsp; Now the tide&#x2019;s risen and swallowed all but one of the Squire Point rocks.&nbsp; Now a pelagic cormorant and three glaucous-winged gulls cluster on that shrinking, kelp-skirted surface.&nbsp; A front&#x2019;s pulled a gray blanket over the Sound.&nbsp; I scan with binoculars the choppy water in front of familiar landmarks &#x2013; Pleiades, Icy Bay, Iktua Passage, Brandt Island, Labyrinth &#x2013; for a black fin that might, at any moment, appear amid those waves.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><h2>The Sword Never Sleeps: The Knights of Myth Drannor, Book III</h2><p>The thrilling conclusion to Ed Greenwood's latest epic!<br><br>Florin Falconhand and his friends have always wanted adventure--but when it finally finds them, it turns out to be a lot more than they bargained for.

With this book you learn how to master the art of conversation. By doing this you get to have more friends and better friends. People will like you more and you will find people you like. I noticed that I was being a much better conversationalist after reading the first few chapters! The book is very easy to understand and I flew right through it. Although it is easy to understand it has a lot of info so you have to pay attention to every tidbit. I reviewed a few chapters cause I felt I may have missed something important. When reading the book I found myself saying &#34;Why didn&#39;t I think of that?&#34;. Everything just seems so logical. We have so many opportunities we just miss and we make people think we don&#39;t want to talk and we fail to see how foolish we are. Who would have thought that a smile, a nod of the head, and having open arms would make people approach you! Its so simple and yet we fail to do it.

She suggested that maybe I should talk about the fortieth anniversary of <i>Star Trek: The Original Series.</i> </p><p> My initial reaction was: <i>Forty years? Wow. That's fantastic!</i> </p><p> Then a second thought came to mind. <i>That's not possible. I'm not</i> that <i>old.</i> </p><p> But I am. I can recall every Friday evening during my high school years. I would always be home to watch <i>Star Trek</i>. (Okay, that should give you a pretty good idea of what my social life was like when I was a teenager, but let's not go there.) Suffice it to say, <i>Star Trek</i> was an important element in my life during those years. </p><p> In hindsight, I realize that the reason I would insist on watching the show every week was clear: I didn't like being where I was during those high school years. What kid really does? <i>Star Trek</i> gave me an escape, in much the same fashion as the shelves and shelves of Andre Norton, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Robert Heinlein books in my basement bedroom. <i>Star Trek</i> and all of those other books took me out of that house -- out of that teenage life that everybody hates -- to strange new places, distant planets, and awesome adventures. Science fiction, with its wonderful worlds, futures, and messages of hope, was what I turned to for a few hours of not thinking about the world around me. More importantly, though, it let me believe that a better future was possible. </p><p> Remember the world in which <i>Star Trek</i> was born? The cities of this country were going up in flames, and bombs were going off so often that only the regional ones were reported. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Bobby Kennedy were shot. Nixon was elected to his first term. And the war just kept getting bigger and bigger. I believed from almost the moment I understood what Vietnam was about that I would be drafted, when I got out of high school. To me, it also meant that I would eventually be shot at and maybe killed. </p><p> That I would be drafted in the fall of 1969 seemed inevitable. It was a fact that all guys thought about a great deal in those days. We didn't talk about it much, though. It was just too scary to talk about. </p><p> I was one of those who didn't believe the war was right, but I also didn't believe in copping out by cutting and running. So there I was, stuck in a life I didn't much like, with a future of war and likely death facing me. </p><p> So, you can see why I made it home every Friday night to watch the original <i>Star Trek.</i> And I have a pretty good memory of writing a letter when they tried to cancel the show in 1968. </p><p> I can't imagine what I would have thought if some time traveler had walked up to me during those years and said, "In forty years, you will have managed to stay out of Vietnam. You will have written over twenty <i>Star Trek</i> novels, edited several <i>Star Trek</i> anthologies for new writers, and written a few <i>Star Trek</i> scripts." I'm sure I would have just laughed. Being a part, even a minor part, of such a unique show would never have crossed my mind in 1966. </p><p> About thirteen years ago, my wife and I got the chance to join in creating some of this wonderful universe, and we jumped at it. Writing under the name Sandy Schofield, we wrote <i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Big Game.</i> Suddenly, I was a <i>Star Trek</i> writer. And it's such a high for me that I get to give new writers out there the same chance. </p><p> In nine volumes, there have been almost two hundred new <i>Star Trek</i> stories. Over one hundred different writers have joined in inventing <i>Star Trek, the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager,</i> and <i>Enterprise.</i> I'm sure every one of them, since they are all fans, can talk about the influence <i>Star Trek,</i> in every incarnation, had in their lives, just as I can. The shows, now shown in syndication, continue to influence future generations as well. </p><p> With the world becoming a little rougher than it has been the last few decades, we now need the wonderful vision of the future that <i>Star Trek</i> brings us even more. We need the escape, the hope, and the belief that mankind goes forward. </p><p> At the moment, we only have the books and games that can bring <i>Star Trek</i> and its hope and vision to all of us. You hold it in your hand. You are the cutting edge of <i>Star Trek</i> -- written by the fans, people like you and me, who love this universe almost more than our real one. </p><p> For forty exceptional years, <i>Star Trek</i> has given us all a look ahead, a wonderful escape into a great universe. So sit back, turn off the news, and let a few of your fellow fans take you away on twenty-three wonderful trips into the future. You won't want to come home.</p></p><h2>The Divine Comedy</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Instead of the wealth and fame he could have claimed, he had chosen a mountain lair, high in the lonely country bordering on the clouds. There the grizzled old warrior kept company with snow leopards and awaited his old enemy death. The Fortress Mighty Dros Delnoch, protected by six outer walls, the only route by which an army could pass through the mountains. It was the stronghold of the Drenai empire.

And hope rested on the skills of that one old man...</p><p>David Gemmell is so committed to his work that he's offered to leap naked out of an airplane if it would appeal to readers. We haven't taken him up on the offer. However, David has also acknowledged that three of his major influences were Louis Lamour, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Stan Lee. Tolkien wrote back, Lamour passed away before David had any opportunity to contact him, and Stan Lee lived thousands of miles away from David's British home. One out of three wasn't bad, but it could be improved upon.<br><br>We were at the San Diego ComicCon, rustling up new readers, and David had just finished a two-hour continuous signing. A friend of mine spotted a familiar face, so I excused myself and darted away, returning a few moments later to say, "David Gemmell, I'd like you to meet Stan Lee." A tall, ruddy, and normally poised individual, David was struck speechless. Here was the man who, through his Marvel Comics stories, had reinvented the relationship between heroes and villains, forever blurring the barriers between good and evil. Before long the two fantasists were chatting away happily. Stan's wife, Joan, being British, was especially gracious to the London-born Gemmell. And Stan quickly demanded an autographed copy of LEGEND.<br><br>David's a dynamic storyteller. His lands live and breathe. His heroes are mighty swordsmen, ax-wielders, and post-apocalyptic adventurers. In their prime they were the best in the business, but in David's tales, they've often passed their prime, so all they really want is peace and quiet. But life (and the author) aren't that kind, and these heroes are forced out of retirement, forced to face bloody hordes of the undead, armies from Hell. Worse, his heroes are generally saddled with young, green heroes. (Nothing drives you crazy more than a cocky kid.) But they overcome, and the cocky kids become heroes, too. This is great reading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Steve Saffel, Senior Editorin of the Axe, was the stuff of legends. But even as the stories grew in the telling, Druss himself grew older. He turned his back on his own legend and retreated to a mountain lair to await his old enemy, death. Meanwhile, barbarian hordes were on the march. Nothing could stand in their way. Druss reluctantly agreed to come out of retirement. But could even Druss live up to his own legends?</p><h2>Meter in English: A Critical Engagement</h2><p>Renowned poets and experts in metrics respond to Robert Wallace&#39;s pivotal essay which clarifies and simplifies methods of studying poetry. Former United States Poet Laureate Robert Hass has called Wallace&#39;s essay a paradigm shift in our understanding of English prosody.</p><p>In 1993, poet, author, and teacher Robert Wallace wrote an essay, &#34;Meter in English&#34;, to clarify and simplify methods of studying the line-by-line rhythms and structure of poetry. When David Baker circulated Wallace&#39;s essay to other poets and student of prosody, the ten propositions it contained elicited an excited and powerful reaction from each respondent. Some strongly concurred; others expressed rousing disagreement. United States Poet Laureate Robert Haas called the essay &#34;a paradigm shift&#34; in our understanding of English prosody. David Baker has gathered Wallace&#39;s essay, fourteen essay-length responses - from poets as divergent in practice as Timothy Steele and Robert Hass, John Frederick Nims and Eavan Boland - and an extensive afterword by Wallace that brings the argument full circle. With Wallace&#39;s ten points as a common benchmark, the respondents have created an unparalleled sampling of thought on the status of meter in poetics today and the rich diversity of opinion on how poems achieve their sound and rhythm. Taken as a whole, the collection becomes a lastingly valuable teaching guide to meter as it&#39;s understood by some of its finest scholars and makers.David Baker is author or editor of fourteen books of poetry and criticism. He holds the Thomas B.

Very few, however, are clear about exactly why, except for their recollections of the famous writers and poets who gave the city a reputation for literature and learning.<br><br>In this book, historian Thomas H. O'Connor sets the matter straight by showing that Boston's eminence during the first half of the nineteenth century was the result of a much broader community effort. After the nation emerged from its successful struggle for independence, most Bostonians visualized their city not only as the Cradle of Liberty, but also as the new world's Cradle of Civilization. <br><br>According to O'Connor, a leadership elite, composed of men of prominent family background, Unitarian beliefs, liberal education, and managerial experience in a variety of enterprises, used their personal talents and substantial financial resources to promote the cultural, intellectual, and humanitarian interests of Boston to the point where it would be the envy of the nation. Not only did writers, scholars, and philosophers see themselves as part of this process, but so did physicians and lawyers, ministers and teachers, merchants and businessmen, mechanics and artisans, all involved in creating a well-ordered city whose citizens would be committed to the ideals of social progress and personal perfectibility. <br><br>To accomplish their noble vision, leading members of the Boston community joined in programs designed to cleanse the old town of what they felt were generations of accumulated social stains and human failures, and then to create new programs and more efficient institutions that would raise the cultural and intellectual standards of all its citizens. Like ancient Athens, Boston would be a city of great statesmen, wealthy patrons, inspiring artists, and profound thinkers, headed by members of the "happy and respectable classes" who would assume responsibility for the safety, welfare, and education of the "less prosperous portions of the community."<br><br>Designed for the general reader and the historical enthusiast, <i>The Athens of America</i> is an interpretive synthesis that explores the numerous secondary sources that have concentrated on individual subjects and personalities, and draws their various conclusions into a single comprehensive narrative.</p><p>"No one knows Boston history as well as Thomas H. O'Connor. In a long and distinguished scholarly career, he has learned to present the story clearly and compellingly in both lectures and books that have illuminated our understanding of Boston. . . . I think this is his best book&#x2014;-he has such a command of the subject, knowing both the broad historical story and the telling detail that brings it to life."--Robert J.

Currently, most of her time is spent studying the Scriptures, writing various books, and taking long walks along the country roads and woodland paths near her home.Bible commentaries for children? Yes, the depth of Bible commentaries in story form for parents to read to their children. This series of books provides what children need solid truths to grow in to. Too much material for children is so light and fluffy that children are not encouraged to think great and glorious thoughts about God. These books are different. Artfully written, they beautifully draw out the implications of the Old Testament narrative that are foundational for Christian faith. I guarantee that your children will not want you to stop reading these books and you won t want to stop either. --Dr. Tedd Tripp<br><br>Interesting and very competent ... a major contribution! --Dr. D. A. Carson<br><br>Nancy Ganz's commentaries for children are unique in their field. They masterfully combine biblical theology, covenantal theology, historical theology, and practical theology, such that both children and adults may profit immensely from them. Children are gripped by them. They are great aids for parents in family worship. Even pastors can learn from them, particularly in how to bring truth to the mind and conscience of the young. --Joel R.

With the widespread adoption of photographic reproductive methods, mezzotint use shifted to the creation of original images. Wax, who is a mezzotint artist, has combined a history of mezzotint with instructions for artists who wish to work in mezzotint today. Like the mezzotint process, Wax&#39;s text is painstaking and requires patience to complete, but she provides a wealth of information on one of today&#39;s lesser-known printmaking processes. The volume is well illustrated and is suitable for interested laypersons and art historians as well as practicing artists. Publisher: Harry N.

They are the only team of four horses to survive from antiquity. Their origin is uncertain - they were probably cast in the 2nd century AD in Greece or Rome - their journey through history has been remarkable. Wherever they have been displayed the horses have been central as both symbols of beauty and power. The first written reference we have to them is in 4th Century Constantinople where they represented the Emperor&#39;s divine connection. They were then plundered by the Doge of Venice when he torched the city during the fourth crusade. When Napoleon invaded in 1797 the horses were at the top of his shopping list and on their removal to Paris they were at the front of his imperial triumph. The magnificent beasts have been witnesses, therefore, to some of the most tumultuous events in European history. Reading this highly original book is to see these events through the eyes of one of the great international works of art.</p><p>Charles Freeman is the author of THE CLOSING OF THE WESTERN MIND and EGYPT, GREECE AND ROME and organises guided tours in Venice.After Napoleon triumphed over Venice in 1798, he demonstrated his strength by plundering the city-state's greatest treasures, including a set of four Greek or Roman gilded copper horses (their precise origins are not known) adorning St. Mark's loggia and sending them straight to Paris. According to Freeman (<i>A.D. 381</i>), the horses were prime booty, symbolizing wealth, cultural assets, and military prowess. Thus, they were periodically looted by history's victors, going first to Constantinople and then to Venice after its defeat of the declining Byzantine capital in 1204. After Napoleon's fall, Venice recovered the horses from Paris. Despite Freeman's efforts, too much remains unknown about the horses (such as how Constantinople originally obtained them), and the statues become almost peripheral to the narrative of the political and cultural environments of the 13th to 19th centuries. Freeman supposes the horses may have inspired artists such as Paolo Uccello and D�rer, who visited Venice. Most compelling for devout lovers of art and European history, Freeman effectively and ironically juxtaposes the horses' location (atop a church) with the violence that punctuated their role as plundered plunder.

There are two major sections of the book. The first section contains the primary text dealing with the doctrinal understanding of the Diacaonate, vocation, formation, life and ministry of the Deacon as well as a chapter on diocesan organization for an Office of Deacon formation and ministry. This secition is followed by an adequate index. The second section of the book is made up of two secondary documents, "Basic Statement for Readiness" and "Visits of Consultation Teams to Diocesan Permanent Diaconate Formation Programs." The "Basis Readiness..." offers several models for evaluating the candidate's readiness and the document on consultation teams is the sixth edition of the work by the Bishops' Committee on the Diaconate which provides information on the approval and evaluation of Deacon formation programs." "This work is an important reference work along with <i>Basic Norms for the Formation of Permanent Deacons<i> and should be in all Catholic libraries."

Caponata, Gambino-style Fried Chicken, Lobster Thermidor (for when you want to celebrate that big score), and desserts rich enough to melt a loan shark's heart. Readers can follow these recipes and learn to cook Italian anytime, anywhere, even on the lam, even in places where Italian groceries may be hard or impossible to find. Tested by Mob heavy hitters as well as FBI agents and U.S. marshals, these recipes are simple to follow, full of timesaving shortcuts, and liberally seasoned with Joe Dogs's stories of life inside -- and outside -- the Mob. This is the perfect cookbook for anyone who wants to make the kind of food that Tony Soprano only <i>dreams</i> about.</p><p><b>Joseph "Joe Dogs" Iannuzzi</b> is the author of <i>Joe Dogs: The Life and Crimes of a Mobster, The Mafia Cookbook,</i> and <i>The Mafia Cookbook: Revised and Expanded.</i><b><i>Introduction</i></b><br><br>I like to cook. I've always liked to cook. That is, as long as I didn't have to cook, I liked it. It was when I was made to cook that I hated it, because if I didn't do it they'd either fire me or, later, fire <i>at</i> me.<br><br>I learned the hard way. How to cook, that is. When I was a kid my stepfather kicked me out of the house. He was an Irish bastard. So I had to learn quick. You follow me? I think I was thirty-eight or thirty-nine years old when that Irish __ told me to cop a walk. Just kidding. I was fifteen years old. So I bounced around the pool halls until I was old enough to join the army. I was a GFU (General Flake-Up), so I was constantly on KP. The mess sergeant went out of his way to show me different recipes to cook and bake. Not because he was such a nice and generous guy. Because he was a fat, lazy SOB who wanted me to learn so he could laze around on his fat ass all day.<br><br>After the army I got married and divorced and married and divorced and, in the early fifties, somehow found myself in Cleveland, Ohio. I needed a job, so I applied for work in one of the classiest restaurants in Cleveland. The chef who interviewed me laughed like hell when I told him my references and experiences. "Joey," the chef said, "if you promise me to forget everything you've learned about cooking I'll give you a job." <i>Voil�!</i> I was in. The kitchen. As a saucier.<br><br>I learned how to make soups and sauces, and I experimented cooking with brandies and different wines. After six months I figured I had the experience to cook anywhere, even the Big Apple, my hometown. So I stole another car and drove back to New York. (I couldn't very well drive the stolen car that had taken me to Ohio back to New York.) Back in New York: another marriage, another divorce. Oh-for-three.<br><br>Anyway, I worked in different diners and restaurants around New York, cooking food and making book. Through my bookmaking partners I got an application to join a very exclusive club: the Mothers And Fathers Italian Association -- MAFIA, for short. Normally you needed a college degree to be accepted, as there were some very intelligent guys in this club. Some could <i>almost</i> read and write. But they let me slide into their club because of my cooking. They said they would "learn" me the rules and regulations as time went on.<br><br>Now, mobsters love to eat. They eat while planning crimes and they eat after committing crimes, and when there are no crimes, they eat while waiting for them to happen. And mobsters are very picky. They know what they like, and when they like it they eat all of it. And then more. Look at the stomachs on these guys the next time television shows one of them being escorted into court in handcuffs. These are some very serious eaters.<br><br>Which is why some of these recipes call for such heavy sauces. Remember the crowd I was feeding -- any meal may be their last, so it better be a good one. Crime may not pay, but it sure gives you a hell of an appetite.<br><br>So don't be scared off by the butter and cream. Just serve the richer sauces on the side instead of dumping them on top of the food.<br><br>My cooking for my mentor, my rabbi, my <i>compare,</i> Tommy Agro, came in very handy, as "T.A." was constantly on the lam. Tommy A. and his crew were forever traveling to different apartments in different states to lay low, and we'd always leave in a rush and I wouldn't even get to pack up my pots and pans and knives. "Leave them, Joey" was T.A.'s familiar refrain. "We'll buy new ones." Despite these culinary hardships, lamming it was a good experience. I was perfecting my craft.<br><br>The members of my new club ate a lot of veal and an awful lot of pasta. But that didn't stop me from experimenting with dishes. I'd never tell the crew what I was cooking if it wasn't a recipe from the old country. They wouldn't have eaten it (and they might have shot me). But once they were licking their chops, I'd let them in on the fact that they were wolfing down Mandarin Pork Roast, or Steak au Poivre, and I never received a complaint.<br><br>I cooked for the club -- among other jobs -- for about ten years. Then I had a terrible accident. I kept walking into this baseball bat and this iron pipe. Some of my pals were trying to see if my head was harder than those two instruments. It was, just barely. But because of this experience I was enticed to join another club on a sort of double-secret probation. This club was called the Full-Blooded Italians, or FBI, for short. The guys in my new club asked me to spy on the guys in my old club who had tried to kill me. I had no problem with that. Revenge, like my Cicoria Insalata, is best eaten cold.<br><br>When it came to food, the members of my new club were no different from the members of my old club. They all ate like they were going to the chair. You don't have to eat that way with the recipes in this book. You just have to enjoy them. Because they've been tested on the worst of the worst and the best of the best. And they've all passed with flying colors.<br><br>Copyright � 1993, 2001 by Joseph Iannuzzi</p><h2>AD 381: Heretics, Pagans and the Christian State</h2><p>A provoking and timely examination of one of the most important moments in Church history.<br><br>In 381 AD, Theodosius, emperor of the eastern Roman Empire, issued a decree in which all his subjects were required to subscribe to a belief in the Trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This edict defined Christianity; all other interpretations were now declared heretical. Moreover, for the first time in a thousand years of Greco-Roman civilization, free thought was unambiguously suppressed. Yet surprisingly, this political revolution, intended to bring inner cohesion to an empire under threat from the outside, has been airbrushed from the historical record. Instead, it has been claimed that the Christian Church had reached a consensus on the Trinity which was promulgated at the Council of Constantinople in 381.<br><br>This groundbreaking new book shows that the Council was in fact a shambolic affair, which only took place after Theodosius&#x2019;s decree had become law. In short, the Church was acquiescing in the overwhelming power of the Emperor. Freeman argues that the edict and the subsequent suppression of paganism not only brought an end to religious and philosophical diversity throughout the Empire, but created numerous theological problems for the Church that have remained unsolved. The year AD 381, Freeman concludes, marked &#x201c;a turning point which time forgot.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Charles Freeman is a freelance academic and the author of more than five books, including the <b>Closing of the Western Mind</b> and <b>The Horses of St. Mark&#x2019;s</b>.&#34;Even if theology and ancient history are subjects you avoid, you should not miss this book.

She's bright, sharp-tongued, and even has "shoulder-length dark blonde hair." Fortunately for Dr. Laura, the similarities end there. During an episode of <i>Ask Dr. Susan</i>, Chandler unwittingly gets herself tangled in the web of a dangerous serial killer. It begins innocently enough when Chandler invites Dr. Donald Richards, a criminologist/psychiatrist/author to talk about his book, <i>Vanishing Women</i> and the plight of lonely women who are preyed upon by calculating killers. Chandler is particularly interested in the disappearance of woman named Regina Clausen, a high-profile investment advisor who vanished on a luxury cruise. Chandler feels indebted to Clausen--an investing tip she offered on CNBC turned a modest birthday check into a "bonanza"--so the good doctor uses her radio forum to help crack the case. Sure enough, during the last moments of the show, a nervous, married woman who goes by the name "Karen" calls in with invaluable clues. Apparently, she was almost a victim and can identify the murderer, but is frightened to come forward because of an insanely jealous husband. As Dr. Susan pursues her timid witness and digs deeper into the case, she realizes a hair too late that she is also one of the hunted. The fast-moving story line and easily digestible plot of <i>You Belong to Me</i> is vintage Mary Higgins Clark. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i>In this breathtaking new novel from the reigning diva of suspense, a psychopathic killer stalks lonely women aboard cruise ships -- giving grisly new significance to the lyrics of an old sweet song...<p>When psychologist Dr. Susan Chandler uses her call-in radio show to explore the issue of lonesome women who disappear and are later found to have been victims of seductive killers, she has no way of knowing she is exposing herself -- and those closest to her -- to the very horror she is warning others against.</p><p>After a listener calls in offering information about the mysterious disappearance from a luxury ocean liner of wealthy investment advisor Regina Clausen, the caller meets with a terrible accident. Or so say the police. As Susan begins to investigate, she quickly finds herself in a race against time -- and an assassin who targets not only vulnerable women, but anyone who might offer clues to his identity. Inching closer to the truth, Susan makes shocking dual discoveries: that the killer may be an important figure in her own life, and that she herself is marked for murder. </p><p>As unpredictable as it is daring, YOU BELONG TO ME delivers a series of electrifying jolts as Mary Higgins Clark makes yet another brilliant entry in the annals of classic suspense.</p></p><h2>Being Enough</h2><p>Is there ever enough time, enough money, enough power within us to do all that our lives seem to require of us? Most of us feel our inadequacies keenly, and the fear of failure can keep us from reaching out and offering what little we do have. Citing the New Testament story of the widow who cast her two mites into the temple treasury, Sister Chieko N. Okazaki demonstrates that a feeling of abundance is rooted in faith.</p><p></p><h2>Quantum Psychology</h2><p>Softcover, as shown. Corners bumped &amp; w/some coverwear &amp; creasing.

Historically important and emotionally resonant, these characters appeal to every class of follower. Metaphorically and rhetorically powerful, they invite constant reimagining across time. <br><br>Focusing on representations of the ghost and monk from the late eighteenth century to the present, Justin Thomas McDaniel builds a case for interpreting modern Thai Buddhist practice through the movements of these transformative figures. He follows embodiments of the ghost and monk in a variety of genres and media, including biography, film, television, drama, ritual, art, liturgy, and the Internet. Sourcing nuns, monks, laypeople, and royalty, he shows how relations with these figures have been instrumental in crafting histories and modernities. McDaniel is especially interested in local conceptions of being "Buddhist" and the formation and transmission of such identities across different venues and technologies. <br><br>Establishing an individual's "religious repertoire" as a valid category of study, McDaniel explores the performance of Buddhist thought and ritual through practices of magic, prognostication, image production, sacred protection, and deity and ghost worship, and clarifies the meaning of multiple cultural configurations. Listening to popular Thai Buddhist ghost stories, visiting crowded shrines and temples, he finds concepts of attachment, love, wealth, beauty, entertainment, graciousness, security, and nationalism all spring from engagement with the ghost and the monk and are as vital to the making of Thai Buddhism as venerating the Buddha himself.</p><p>Focusing on representations of a famous ghost and monk from the late eighteenth century to today, Justin Thomas McDaniel builds a case for interpreting modern Thai Buddhist practice through the movements of these transformative figures.

In a few short weeks, he raised an army large enough to challenge the government&#x2019;s forces in Scotland and, against the odds, stormed to a shocking victory over them at the Battle of Prestonpans. Celebrated ever since in song and art, Prestonpans nevertheless proved to be a false dawn on the road to defeat at the Battle of Culloden seven months later, but without his victory at Prestonpans and all the opportunities it provided, Charles Edward Stuart ('Bonnie Prince Charlie') could never have invaded England and his short uprising would then have been but a footnote in the history of Georgian Britain. <br><br>This book - the climax of years of on-site investigation and source analysis - pieces together the events of the Prestonpans campaign in unprecedented detail. Focusing on the week of the battle, the author&#x2019;s knowledge of the towns and villages through which the armies marched brings their motions vividly to life. Combined with eyewitness testimonies and close scrutiny of the evidence presented to the Board of Inquiry in 1746, this allows the reader to understand the buildup to the battle from an individual, as well as strategic, level. Such an understanding is revealed as critical, as the effects of morale, landscape and personality are shown to have determined the fate of the battle far more than the relative power of broadsword and bayonet. <br><br>The book opens with an exploration of the battlefield area prior to the Rising, before analyzing the political and military strengths and weaknesses of the opposing causes; this includes rarely-provided information on the career of Sir John Cope. After following the opening campaign in the Highlands, the reader is then taken on a detailed day-by-day journey through the week leading to the battle. The account of the engagement itself - driven by eyewitness testimony and contemporary evidence - also incorporates the latest archaeological analysis of the site to create the most detailed and engaging presentation yet of this famous and dramatic event. Its aftermath and legacy, both on a local and national level, is then considered before the book concludes with a look at the changes which have occurred across the battlefield landscape up to the present day. <br><br>This is a study of one of Britain&#x2019;s best-documented, but least analyzed, battles - seen from within the landscape and communities around which it was fought. No longer should the two days of events which make up the Battle of Prestonpans be viewed simply as the prologue to a future defeat; instead, they are presented as they were understood at the time: as the climax of a month-long campaign which, it seemed, would determine the fate of Scotland.</p><p>Dr Arran Paul Johnston was born and raised in Derbyshire, where he first discovered the interest in the Jacobite Risings which would later lead him to Scotland.

I'd lived in Qualla Boundary during high school. That was longer than I'd lived anywhere else up until then, but in the intervening decade I'd lived exclusively in Seattle. But North Carolina still twigged as <em>home,</em> maybe because it was where my father had been born.<br><br>It was where he'd gone missing from, too, and that was why I was back.<br><br>Driving up from Atlanta was a slow immersion into memories. I had the windows of my rented Impala rolled down, and the rich rotting scent of winter collapsing into spring made a hungry place at the hollow of my throat. Of course, everything made me hungry right now&#x2014;I hadn't yet recovered from a week's worth of exhaustive shape-shifting fueled by my body's resources instead of food. But that slightly sweet smell of death begetting life had always made me hungry, and I'd forgotten that until now.<br><br>The low hills with a haze of new leaves lining the roads; the roads themselves narrowing as I pulled away from inter-states; the way strangers stopped along the roadside would nod a greeting as I passed by: those things I remembered more clearly. Then again, I'd spent an awful lot of my formative years in cars, crisscrossing the country with my father. Things I could see from a vehicle were most likely to stay with me, maybe.<br><br>Like the sign welcoming the world to the Qualla. It was smaller than I remembered it. I was taller than I'd been fourteen years ago when Dad had driven us past that sign for the first time, but mostly its size was relative to its importance in my life. Back then those carved white words on a brown road sign had been the most important thing in my life. <em>Welcome: Cherokee Indian Reservation.</em> At thirteen, going on fourteen, I'd never belonged anywhere for more than a few months, and that welcome sign was supposed to be the start of a whole new life for me.<br><br>It had been, too. Just not the way I'd expected it to be.<br><br>I slowed the car as I drove into the town of Cherokee. It was equal parts bigger and better than I remembered it, and exactly the same. The main street was four lanes rolling through town, no sidewalks to mention, just road, then parking spaces, then tourist shops flush up against them. A lot of low brown buildings with statues of headdressed Indian chiefs or protective gleaming black bears in front of them, and&#x2014;new to me&#x2014;signs making sure everybody knew which way to drive to the casino. It had opened the year before I left the Qualla, and the bigger-better aspects of Cherokee probably had it to thank. There'd been tourism money half the year before that, and unemployment the other half. That was the Cherokee I remembered, but I was just as glad it had moved on.<br><br>I got out of my car in front of the sheriff's station. Wind came down off the blue mountains and caught the skirt of my white leather coat with cinematic flair. For half a second I wished I was as cool as the woman reflected in the car window looked. Somebody that cool, though, probably wouldn't have a stomach full of butterflies, and her hands wouldn't shake as she took off her sunglasses. I'd burned bridges, mentally if not actually, when I'd left the Qualla. Coming back scared the crap out of me.<br><br>A man about my own age stepped through the station's open front door, leaned in the frame and said, "I'll be damned. Joanne Walkingstick's come home."<br><br>All the butterflies got squished as my stomach clenched. I'd Anglicized my last name the minute I left Cherokee, calling myself Walker. Excepting a handful of magic users, nobody had called me Joanne Walkingstick in ten years. I'd somehow forgotten that's who I would be, back here.<br><br>"You haven't changed," the guy said, which was wildly untrue, although in physical terms he was right. I was still six feet tall with short-cropped black hair, and ten years wasn't enough for most people to lose the youth they'd had graduating high school. I looked like me, albeit better-dressed.<br><br>The fellow in the door looked like himself, too, though it took me a good twenty seconds before I said, "Lester," and even that I said slowly. It took another moment to finish with "You cut your hair. And you're a <em>cop?"</em><br><br>"Who better than the local troublemaker? Figure I at least have a clue what the kids are on about. I hear you're a brother in blue, too." Lester Lee pushed out of the door and stepped forward to offer his hand. I shook it automatically, still trying to get past the silver badge on his chest and the tidy police haircut. Last time I'd seen Les, he'd had hair to his ass and had been smoking pot during our graduation ceremony. Other than that, he did look like himself: pleasant dark eyes, wide cheekbones, reasonably fit and about four inches shorter than I. "I was," I said a bit absently. "I just quit. I've had othe&#x2014;<br><br>Who told you that?"<br><br>"Sara."<br><br>"She's here." Of course she was here. Sara Buchanan, now Sara Isaac, was the one who'd called to tell me my father was missing. We'd been best friends about half a lifetime ago, right up until I blew it by sleeping with the boy she liked. In my defense, she'd said she didn't like him, and my social skills hadn't been well enough developed to recognize the lie. Either way, the friendship had ended. But we'd reconnected, if that was the right word for an encounter over half-eaten dead men, about four months earlier. When that case was over, I'd never expected to hear from her again.<br><br>"Lucas came with her," Les said, watching me.<br><br>My stomach went to knots again, though I wasn't surprised. Lucas Isaac had been the boy, back then. He'd gone home to Vancouver before my pregnancy became obvious, but he and Sara had kept in touch and eventually got married. I'd always refused to answer questions about who the father of my twins was, and had thought nobody knew. Judging from Les's expression, if everybody hadn't known then, they did now. That was awkward, so I ignored it.<br><br>"I'm more worried about my dad. Les, what's going on? Sara called and said he was missing, but she wouldn't say anything else." That wasn't exactly true. She'd said it was "my kind of thing," which I took to mean it appeared to be something paranormal in nature.<br><br>"She wouldn't&#x2014;" Les broke off with a cough, then jerked his chin toward the station. "Come in and sit down a minute, Joanie. We&#x2014;"<br><br>"Joanne. Or Jo, please. I don't use Joanie much anymore." Actually it had only just struck me in the past few days that I'd left the little-girl nickname behind, but Les didn't have to know that.<br><br>He lifted an eyebrow. "You hated being called Jo." With that observation he went inside, leaving me to look at the dark square of doorway with a blush mounting my cheeks.<br><br>We hadn't been particular friends, Lester Lee and me. I hadn't been particular friends with much of anybody, truth be told, because I'd had a chip the size of Idaho on my shoulder. I had my Irish mother's pale skin, which made me unnecessarily self-conscious about coming to the Qualla, and the only long-term companion I'd ever had was my father. Coming into a high school of kids who'd known each other since birth made me horribly uncomfortable, and I'd mostly been a complete jerk through my adolescent years. I could not for the life of me imagine why Les knew I didn't like being called Jo, when I couldn't even remember talking to him more than five times in the years I'd been here. But he knew it, and I was once more smacked in the face with the realization that if I'd been less of a jackass, I'd probably have had a lot more fun in school. I sighed and followed Les inside the cop shop.<br><br>Last time I'd been in there it had been to hack my personal files in their computers, changing my last name from Walkingstick to Walker on my driver's license. By the time it propagated to the state system I'd left North Carolina and Joanne Walkingstick behind.<br><br>The station hadn't changed a lot since then. The computers were better and so was the system they were linked into. I probably wouldn't be able to hack it anymore. Of course, I wouldn't need to. I could just access any files I needed to change from the Seattle Police Department's computers. Or I could have before I'd quit not quite a week ago. I sighed, pushed my hand through my hair and went to sit in one of the surprisingly comfortable chairs by Les's desk. Sunlight hung on motes of dust between us, making the whole world seem like it was standing still. "All right. Hit me. What'd Sara leave out?"<br><br>"Luke's missing, too."<br><br>Static rushed my ears and for a minute I couldn't say anything. Then I laughed, short and harsh. "Before or after Dad?"<br><br>"Before. Sara and him came into town last Friday. Luke went missing Saturday night and there's been a manhunt on for him. Your dad was helping, but Monday night he didn't come back."<br><br>A house of cards collapsed in my mind, each card with a nugget of information on it. Monday had been the solstice. Dad was some kind of mystic. Those two things probably went together. Sara had called me Wednesday. Midafternoon, Irish time&#x2014;I'd been in Ireland hunting banshees&#x2014;which was morning here in Cherokee. Dad had been missing about thirty-six hours then, and Lucas for seventy-two. Aloud, I said, "You're sure Sara didn't tie Dad up somewhere so she'd have an excuse to call me?"<br><br>Humor creased Les's face, showing what he would look like in another forty years. Like his grandfather, the tribal elder for whom he'd been named. "The thought crossed my mind," he said, "but she was never an outdoorsy type. She'd never get the drop on your Dad."<br><br>"She's an FBI agent now, Les. She could get the drop on most people."<br><br>"Not," Les said firmly, "your Dad," which was probably true. I'd never thought of my father as particularly impressive, but he was the kind of guy who could sit down and disappear into the landscape even if you were looking at him when he sat. Wild animals tended to treat him as if he was one of their own. Sara had learned the ropes well enough to kick my puny ass, but I couldn't see her taking Dad out. "Not if her life depended on it," Les finished, as if following my thoughts.<br><br>"What if Luke's did," I said under my breath, but I didn't really mean it. Not mostly, though I was willing to bet Sara'd been almost relieved when my father went missing, if it meant she had an excuse to call me in. "Why'd she say it was my kind of thing?"<br><br>Les's humor fell away. "I know the elders gave you a drum, Joan&#x2014;<em>Joanne"</em> He emphasized the name, reminding himself not to use the high school nickname.<br><br>A little shock ran through me. There'd been a bit of ceremony involved with the gifting of the drum and logically I supposed half the town knew I'd received it, but logic had never been my strong suit. I sat forward, elbows on my knees, and rubbed my eyes. "Yeah, they did. When I was fifteen."<br><br>"So what happened?" Les's voice dropped, his curiosity softened by what sounded like genuine respect.<br><br>I rubbed my face again, then sat on my hands so I'd stop doing that. "The really short version is I got pregnant and it screwed me up. Everything the drum suggested..." I shrugged. "Went off the rails. I only found the tracks again about fifteen months ago."<br><br>"So you're a..."<br><br>For the first time, I didn't want to answer the question, not because I thought he would laugh, but because of where I was. Sitting in the heart of Qualla Boundary, in all that was left of the once-vast Cherokee nation, in the midst of that, saying "A shaman," somehow sounded very arrogant indeed. There were too many charlatans and quacks out there buying, selling and bartering so-called shamanic gifts, and I'd spent way more of my life off the rez than on. For a minute I felt as false as any of those con artists. I'd never had any use for the mystical. Claiming I was now part of that heritage just seemed wrong.<br><br>Les, though, looked neither offended nor surprised when I said the word. He just nodded and let me work my way around to continuing. "Not quite like the traditional medicine men, as far as I can tell. When this all...woke up...I was told I was on a warrior's path. Healing's only part of it, for me."<br><br>Les's mouth twitched. "You always did like a fight."<br><br>That much, certainly, was true. It was utterly bizarre to talk to someone who had enough knowledge of a younger me to say a thing like that, but it was true. I shrugged one shoulder and tried again. "So why'd Sara think it was my kind of thing?"<br><br>"The mountain's been hollering, Jo. So loud even I can hear it, and I'm no shaman."<br><br>The mountain was hollering. That was an utterly preposterous thing to say, except I had just gotten off a plane from Ireland, where a screaming stone laid out peoples' destinies. Mountains hollering seemed right in line with that. I nodded. "What's it shouting about?"<br><br>"It started the night Lucas went missing." Les shrugged. "Your dad said it was trying to tell us how something was wrong. That's why he went up there, why he went alone. He was looking for Luke like all of us were, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"But he was looking to heal the crying land," I finished.<br><br>Surprise and respect brightened Les's eyes. I could see a question coming, and lifted a hand to ward it off. I'd only just, in the past couple days, discovered my father belonged to a magical bloodline just as much as my mother had. My nomadic childhood had crystallized into a never-before-appreciated kind of sense: Dad had been taking us from one damaged site to another, trying, I now suspected, to give something back to barren earth. I hadn't yet wrapped my mind around the whole idea and wasn't prepared to discuss it. "What happened when he didn't come back?"<br><br>"It got worse. It's echoing all over the mountains now, so bad you can't tell where it starts. My grandpa looks like he's sucking lemons all the time, that's how much it's affecting him. It's worse for some of the other families."<br><br>"Is there anybody it's not affecting?"<br><br>Les's mouth quirked again. I'd had no idea that under the hair and the weed he'd had a pervasive, low-key sense of humor. "Tourists," he said. "White men. Whatever's happening here, Jo, it's not their story. It belongs to the People."<br><br>"I'm half-white, Les."<br><br>"Nah. You grew up in the Qualla."<br><br></p><h2>Three Complete Novels: The Cat Who Tailed a Thief / The Cat Who Sang for the Birds / The Cat Who Saw Stars</h2><p>Reading a Cat Who . . . novel by Lilian Jackson Braun is "like dropping in on old and very dear friends" (<i>The Tampa Tribune-Times</i>).

His reputation has only increased there in the sixty years since his death. Brazilian readers fight over which of his novels is their favorite. Now <i>St. Bernardo</i>, his second-to-last novel, has been freshly translated for North American readers. This gritty, dryly funny book tells the story of Paulo Hon�rio, a field hand who learns to read and write in jail, emerging with the ambition of buying and restoring to greatness the now-decrepit property where he was once a day laborer. <i>St. Bernardo</i>, named for his ranch, is the memoir of his rise and fall, written in his own rough-hewn voice. Flavored with subtle ironies and rich local idioms, <i>St. Bernardo</i> will appeal to readers of William Faulkner and Juan Rulfo, anyone who loves a tragicomic story of a striving outsider and self-made man, ruthless and tender in turns.</p><p><b>Graciliano Ramos</b> (1892&#x2013;1953) was a writer, politician, and journalist. He spent most of his life in Palmeira dos �ndios, in northeast Brazil, where he owned a general store and served as the mayor. In 1936, Ramos was arrested and imprisoned on a penal island.

The tale concerns the journey of the narrator (Marlow) up the Congo River on behalf of a Belgian trading company. Far upriver, he encounters the mysterious Kurtz, an ivory trader who exercises an almost godlike sway over the inhabitants of the region. Both repelled and fascinated by the man, Marlow is brought face to face with the corruption and despair that Conrad saw at the heart of human existence.<br>In its combination of narrative and symbolic power, masterly character study and acute psychological penetration, <i>Heart of Darkness</i> ranks as a landmark of modern fiction.

Then they tell with humor of the day the little cave took possession of them, and with quiet excitement of how that day in Jewel Cave led to nearly two decades of dedicated exploration and mapping--accomplished by Herb and Jan and with small groups of friends--during which the cave grew to over 50 miles of the most intricate three-dimensional networks of underground passages in the world. Fifteen excellent maps--including a giant folded map--guide the reader through the maze as the cave is extended mile by mile. <p>Herb and Jan are originals. They built their stone house against a rock wall, and made their living by playing the guitar, lecturing, and swinging on a rope to clean off the faces on Mount Rushmore.

His favorite phrase is "You can't make me."Grade 5-8&#x2013;This inventive novel has elements of Cornelia Funke's <i>Inkheart</i> (Scholastic, 2003) and Lemony Snicket's "A Series of Unfortunate Events" (HarperCollins). Fern Drudger, an imaginative misfit in her extraordinarily boring family, discovers that she and Howard Bone were switched at birth. The adults decide that the children will spend the summer with their birth parents and Fern meets her father, the Bone. He is an "Anybody"&#x2013;he can change into someone or something else. However, he's not very good at it. He's convinced that Fern can help him find <i>The Art of Being Anybody</i>, a book once owned by his dead wife, which will allow him to improve his skills&#x2013;but he must locate it before his enemy, the Miser, does and stop him from using it for evil purposes. Fern and the Bone end up in disguise at Fern's grandmother's boarding house, a magical, if dilapidated, palace of books, where anything can happen, especially if you happen to be an Anybody. Like Snicket, Bode is an amusing presence within this story about family, imagination, love of the written word, the dangers of hypnosis, and how to put an army of fairies to good use. The writing is fluid, the characters are multifaceted, and the situations range from poignant to gloriously silly. Eye-catching, black-and-white sketches echo the story's nuances and add to the atmosphere. There's laugh-out-loud humor, fantasy, mystery, real-life family drama, and the potential for a sequel.

The historic trial of the &#x201c;Butcher of the Balkans&#x201d; began in 2002 and ended abruptly with Milosevic&#x2019;s death in 2006. Judith Armatta, a lawyer who spent three years in the former Yugoslavia during Milosevic&#x2019;s reign, had a front-row seat at the trial. In <i>Twilight of Impunity</i> she brings the dramatic proceedings to life, explains complex legal issues, and assesses the trial&#x2019;s implications for victims of the conflicts in the Balkans during the 1990s and international justice more broadly. Armatta acknowledges the trial&#x2019;s flaws, particularly Milosevic&#x2019;s grandstanding and attacks on the institutional legitimacy of the International Criminal Tribunal. Yet she argues that the trial provided an indispensable legal and historical narrative of events in the former Yugoslavia and a valuable forum where victims could tell their stories and seek justice. It addressed crucial legal issues, such as the responsibility of commanders for crimes committed by subordinates, and helped to create a framework for conceptualizing and organizing other large-scale international criminal tribunals. The prosecution of Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague was an important step toward ending impunity for leaders who perpetrate egregious crimes against humanity.</p><p>&#34;Judith Armatta spent three incredible years with a front row seat in the trial that many hope will signal a beginning of the end to impunity. Through this book the reader is granted a rare privilege to share Judith&#39;s journey through the trial of Milosevic. As such, &#34;Twilight of Impunity&#34; serves as an indispensable cornerstone to the historical record of the Yugoslav conflict, and is a must read for anyone who seeks to understand how and why genocide returned to Europe.&#34;--Paul R.

Constructed and modified from the sixteenth until the beginning of the twentieth centuries, they are today some of Mexico's architectural treasures.

During the titanic struggle between North and South, both sides demanded Britain&#39;s support. British volunteers fought on both sides; British guns and bullets littered the battlefields. The South depended on British-built cruisers to make up its navy, and British blockade runners to supply its armies. This book portrays the extraordinary web of relationships between the two countries through the lives of over a hundred participants - soldiers, mercenaries, politicians, spies, journalists, diplomats, doctors and nurses who, at home or abroad, recorded their experience of the war. It traces the often desperate efforts of men and women to survive, to preserve the ideals and ways of living they believed were right, and even, sometimes, to find love in the worst of circumstances. &#34;A World On Fire&#34; is history told in the round, combining the human intensity of battle with the manoeuvrings of fraught diplomacy. We see the letters of soldiers fighting thousands of miles from their homeland; the passionate dispatches from diplomats and journalists; and the diaries of the brave women who laboured in some cases to save a single life, and in others to protect an entire way of life. This is a new and dramatic account of the first modern war and of Britain&#39;s part in it, for good or ill.</p><p><p> <strong>Photographs from <i>A World on Fire</i></strong> <br>Click on the photos below to enlarge.<br> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>The trenches at Petersberg, Virginia, 1865</td> <td>Confederate President Jefferson Davis, 1808-1889</td> <td>Victory Parade of the U.S. Army, Washington, D.C.

Includes essays by James Hillman &#34;Bachelard&#39;s Lautreamont, or Psychoanalysis without a Patient,&#34; and Robert Scott Dupree, &#34;Bachelard as Literary Critic.&#34; Bachelard&#39;s only book devoted to a single author/poet. 152 pages, indexed. THE BACHELARD TRANSLATIONS are the inspiration of Joanne H. Stroud, Director of Publications for The Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, who in 1981 contracted with Jos� Corti to publish in English the untranslated works of Bachelard on the imagination. Gaston Bachelard is acclaimed as one of the most significant modern French thinkers. From 1929 to 1962 he authored twenty-three books addressing his dual concerns, the philosophy of science and the analysis of the imagination of matter. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities - art, architecture, literature, language, poetics, philosophy, and depth psychology. His teaching career included posts at the College de Bar-sur-Aube, the University of Dijon, and from 1940 to 1962 the chair of history and philosophy of science at the Sorbonne. One of the amphitheaters of the Sorbonne is called &#34;L&#39;Amphi Gaston Bachelard,&#34; an honor Bachelard shared with Descartes and Richelieu. He received the Grand Prix National Lettres in 1961-one of only three philosophers ever to have achieved this honor. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities-art, architecture, literature, poetics, psychology, philosophy, and language.</p><p>Same as above.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Necroscope: Avengers (Necroscope: E-Branch Trilogy)</h2><p><br>The packed cruise ship is a terrific nesting ground for a Lord and Lady of the Wamphyri on the run from E-Branch and the new Necroscope, Jake Cutter. By the time the ship is reported missing, the few beings still living on board will no longer be human . . . and the Wamphyri will be long fled to their next conquest. <br><br>Korath, the vampire who lurks in Jake Cutter's mind, is determined to gain control of Jake's life, and Jake is equally determined not to let him have it. But to win this struggle Jake must confide in Ben Trask-and Trask, the head of E-Branch, is likely to want Jake dead the minute he learns of Jake's intrusive passenger! <br><br>The spore garden planted under London by the third Wamphyri, Lord Swartz, is bearing bitter fruit indeed as a mysterious sleeping sickness-with a vampiric taint-slowly spreads among the population of Great Britain.<br><br>E-Branch action teams have more on their plates than they can handle. They must locate terrorists who threaten the world with nuclear homicide; permanently close the Gate between the Wamphyri world and Earth; analyze the spore plague; and locate and destroy the three Wamphyri.<br><br>Even the powers of Harry Keogh, the original Necroscope, summoned from the Great Beyond via the combined powers of E-Branch's strongest agents, may not be enough to defeat the monsters who have brought Earth to the brink of total destruction.<br><br></p><p><br>Brian Lumley is the author of the bestselling Necroscope series of vampire novels. The first <i>Necroscope</i>, Harry Keogh, also appears in a collection of Lumley's short fiction, <i>Harry Keogh and Other Weird Heroes</i>, along Titus Crow and Henri Laurent de Marigny, from T<i>itus Crow, Volumes One, Two, and Three</i>, and <i>David Hero and Eldin the Wanderer</i>, from the<i> Dreamlands</i> series. <br><br>An acknowledged master of Lovecraft-style horror, Brian Lumley has won the British Fantasy Award and been named a Grand Master of Horror. His works have been published in more than a dozen countries and have inspired comic books, role-playing games, and sculpture, and been adapted for television.<br><br>When not writing, Lumley can often be found spear-fishing in the Greek islands, gambling in Las Vegas, or attending a convention somewhere in the US. Lumley and his wife live in England.<br><br><br>What Has Gone Before: Invaders and Defilers<p>THREE YEARS AGO, THREE GREAT VAMPIRES--two Lords and a "Lady" of the Wamphyri, the alien originators of the alleged vampire "myths" or "legends" of Earth--entered our world via a transdimensional Gate under the Carpathian Mountains. Having split up following their covert "invasion," the trio went their own ways. Lord Nephran Malinari ("Malinari the Mind") enthralled an Australian billionaire to set himself up in a casino aerie in the exclusive resort of Xanadu in the Macpherson Range. Lord Szwart, a metamorphic "fly-the-light" in the truest sense of the term, headed for London, settling in a forgotten Roman "temple" in the deepest, most inaccessible bowels of the city. And Vavara--"beautiful" mistress of mass hypnotism--defiled an order of nuns by infiltrating their fortresslike monastery on the Greek island of Krassos.</p><p>Their plan to overthrow the planet, reducing it to a vampire paradise, was in essence a simple one: to plant gardens of deadspawn fungi and bring them to deadly maturity. Nurtured on the life fluids (the mutated DNA) of sacrificed vampire thralls or lieutenants, these toadstools when they ripened and spawned would release a myriad of spores into the Earth's atmosphere, to be breathed by an unwitting human race! Then, as men became blood-lusting monsters who hid from the sun during daylight hours and hunted by night, and nation fought nation as the world sank into chaos, and no one--least of all the mazed, blood-addicted victims--was able to understand or even consider fighting the incurable "disease" that was converting them...then the Great Vampires, the Wamphyri, would emerge from the shadows and come into their own.</p><p>As in the earliest days of their predawn Vampire World of Sunside/Starside, their thralls and lieutenants would go abroad in the world, carrying their monstrous plague with them as they consolidated their masters' (and mistress's) territories, where the laws of the Wamphyri would be the only laws. Malinari would take Australia, expanding into all the islands around and eventually Asia, and Vavara would take the Mediterranean and Africa, spreading east to form a border with Malinari. As for the metamorphic horror that was Lord Szwart: while it would seem he had been disadvantaged, with only the British Isles, France, Spain, and the northern and westernmost regions of Europe coming under his control, as he deployed his forces west across the Atlantic, he would quickly seed the Americas with his deadspawn, and when the time was ripe he would move his power base to New York. The metropolis's sprawling underground network would provide access to all parts of the city whether in daylight or darkness, while its greatest building would be Szwart's aerie, its every window lacquered black and draped against the sun.</p><p>These had been the ambitions of the Wamphyri, and they had seemed infallible; their dreams, and an unwitting mankind's as yet unrealized nightmares. But despite their legendary cunning and leechlike tenacity, the three Great Vampires had not reckoned with E-Branch.</p><p>E-Branch (E for ESP): a top-secret arm of the British intelligence services, many of whose psychically talented agents had dealt with vampires before, and not only in this world but also in Sunside/Starside. Ben Trask, the members of his London-based organization, and a small handful of people in the Corridors of Power were the only human beings who knew of the alien invasion. And because of the planetwide panic any disclosure would cause, they didn't dare speak of it to anyone outside their circle.</p><p>But having traced Malinari to Australia (and with the ever-grudging assistance of their Minister Responsible in Whitehall: his help in covertly informing an Australian counterpart of the problem and enlisting military aid), Trask and an E-Branch task force had ventured down under to confront Malinari in his aerie. There in Xanadu they had destroyed his fungi garden (though not without the timely assistance of Jake Cutter, a young man whose extraordinary powers were not yet fully developed or even understood) but The Mind himself had escaped.</p><p>As for Jake Cutter (though more especially from Ben Trask's necessarily cautious point of view):</p><p>Jake seems an entirely wrongheaded man with something of a chequered background. Having fallen foul of a gang of international drug-runners and suffering at their hands, he was bent on settling old scores when strange circumstances brought him into contact with E-Branch. (He was in fact pursuing a vendetta with this criminal organization's powerful leader and several of his close colleagues--people who had raped and murdered a girl of Jake's acquaintance, with whom he had had a brief but passionate affair--and had been responsible for a series of violent, extremely ugly deaths in their higher echelon.)</p><p>But the leader of the gang--a Sicilian vampire named Luigi Castellano--had laid a trap for Jake, causing him to fall into the hands of the Italian police. Incarcerated in a Turin prison, Jake had soon discovered that Castellano was not without influence there, and that Jake's demise had been scheduled for the very near future.</p><p>Then, during a jailbreak (also arranged by Castellano), when it seemed certain that Jake must die under fire from the guards...a weird reprieve, a miraculous escape: Jake's first taste of things to come, and the beginning of his transition.</p><p>Something he took to be a ricochetting bullet--a flash of golden fire--struck him in the forehead. But instead of falling dead he fell into something else entirely and was conveyed through the M�bius Continuum (a means of metaphysical teleportation) to Harry's Room at E-Branch HQ in London.</p><p>Harry's Room:</p><p>The long-dead (?) Necroscope Harry Keogh was once the most important member of E-Branch. On those occasions when he stayed at the London HQ, he had a room of his own, as did many espers. Harry's Room, however, has always been (and still is) different from other rooms. Perhaps to signal their regard for their much loved, highly respected ex-member--or perhaps because the room continues to retain something of the Necroscope's personality--it has been left untouched and unoccupied, exactly as it was in the time of Harry's residence.</p><p>And so it was a singular event for Ben Trask and his espers to discover a bewildered stranger inside the locked room of the Necroscope, in the heart of security-conscious E-Branch HQ! And it had to be more than a mere coincidence...</p><p>Jake's advent had come at a propitious moment (or at least, everyone except Trask thought so), for it was only a short time later that Nephran Malinari was discovered in Xanadu, his playboy retreat and aerie in the mountains of the Macpherson Range. And teaming Jake up with Liz Merrick, a young, attractive, budding telepathic receiver whose powers, like Jake's, were still developing, Trask took them to Australia as part of his task force.</p><p>It was during the course of this largely successful operation that Jake discovered the truth of what Trask and his people had suspected all along: that indeed he had inherited something of Harry's powers. For when the original Necroscope had died on Starside, his metaphysical personality--the sidereal intelligence that was Harry--had fragmented into many golden splinters or darts, one of which had entered into Jake! Now in his dreams Jake could converse with the "dead" Necroscope through the medium of deadspeak. Then, too (not yet aware that his dreams were of crucial importance, that they had real meaning in the waking world and were much more than disturbing symptoms of paramnesia and a crumbling mentality), Jake had felt obliged to ask Trask just what, exactly, a Necroscope was.</p><p>But while Trask had been willing to explain something of a Necroscope's powers to Jake--his ability to teleport, and the unearthly "gift" which enabled him to converse with the dead--there were certain other things that he dared not speak of. For as the director of E-Branch for many years, Trask had developed an enquiring and skeptical mind; he knew how very deceiving outward appearances can be, and how even the most innocent seeming of men (especially the innocent ones: for example, the original Necroscope) may be susceptible to the greatest evils. Moreover, Trask had never had much faith in coincidence or synchronicity. He believed that things usually had good reasons for happening, and that when they happened might be equally relevant...</p><p>Jake had come on the scene at a propitious time, certainly--but for whom? And wasn't it simply too much of a coincidence that at the advent of a trio of Great Vampires out of Starside, a new Necroscope should also put in an appearance? So, had Jake arrived of his own (or Harry Keogh's) accord, by "coincidence," or had he in fact been sent to infiltrate E-Branch? What was it of the original Necroscope--how much of Harry, what element--had entered Jake? Something of his light side, from his earlier life, or something of his far more dangerous side from a later, darker period?</p><p>For one of the several things that Jake didn't yet know was that at the end of the Necroscope's time on Earth he had been a vampire in his own right--Wamphyri! And probably the greatest of them all! And not only Harry but two of his sons: they, too, had been vampires, changeling creatures, on Starside in a weird parallel world...</p><p>Thus Trask's doubts--or more properly his natural caution, coupled with his inability to read the young Necroscope despite that his own weird talent made him a human lie detector--held him back from bringing Jake more fully into his confidence. For if Jake was not the real thing, if he had not inherited Harry's mantle to become the fantastic weapon against the Wamphyri that most of Trask's agents believed him to be, but rather possessed the potential to become the exact opposite...then Trask might yet have to kill him!</p><p>Hence his great quandary, for if on the other hand Jake was the real thing, and if he was made privy to everything, then he might easily shy from the knowledge--the full knowledge--of what he was becoming and what he would be capable of doing, and would be lost to E-Branch forever. For while it takes a special kind of man to accept the responsibilities of a Necroscope, the role of caretaker to the dead, it takes an extra special man to accept that the Great Majority will do almost anything for love of him...including the agony and horror of self-resurrection, of rising from their graves in order to protect him!</p><p>After the Australian venture, when Jake was given the comparative "freedom" of E-branch HQ--if not access to all of its many secrets--the first thing he did was desert the cause in order to pursue his own agenda: his vendetta with Castellano. But the fact was that Jake didn't see his leaving as any kind of treachery; his reasons for walking out on Ben Trask and E-Branch were more than one, and not least self-preservation.</p><p>First, the Harry Keogh influence had been replaced by something of a far more disturbing nature: Jake was finding himself under constant attack from a deceased vampire lieutenant called Korath (once Korath Mindsthrall), an ex-minion of Malinari. Dead and sloughed away in a subterranean sump in Romania, Korath had used deadspeak to tell Jake the histories of the three Wamphyri invaders from Starside--but in the process he had also tricked his way into semiresidence in Jake's head. Only let Jake relax and let his mental shields down, Korath would be there with him in his mind, dreaming his dreams, conversing with him, attempting to influence--to "guide" or "advise" him--and generally sharing his waking world experiences. Jake could send him away, back to his sump, but he could never be absolutely certain when Korath was or wasn't there.</p><p>The only good thing to come out of this was that Korath had "inherited" something of his former master's mentalism; endowed with eidetic recall, he'd memorized the mathematical M�bius formula given to Jake by Harry Keogh--which for some reason Jake was unable to grasp--and had thus become his reluctant host's one and only key to the metaphysical M�bius Continuum's mode of trans- or teleportation.</p><p>And so he and Jake had worked out a compromise. All Korath wanted--or so he had led Jake to believe--was revenge on his former master and the other Great Vampires for killing him as a means of accessing our world. But since Korath was incorporeal, a dead creature whose sole contact with the living was through Jake and his deadspeak, the new Necroscope was the only one who could possibly exact such a revenge. Jake couldn't go about his business without Korath, and Korath would have no existence at all without Jake.</p><p>One other problem with Korath: if Ben Trask found out about his coexistence with Jake, it might yet be a case of having to kill two birds with one stone--or more properly one man and a parasitic mind-thing with however many bullets were required to do the job.</p><p>But even that, self-preservation, wasn't Jake's only reason for quitting the Branch. In fact he was driven to leave by some unknown but increasingly insistent force which demanded that he pursue his own--or perhaps someone else's?--agenda. Moreover, the longer he remained with E-Branch, the greater the chance of a romantic attachment to Liz Merrick, with whom he'd developed a semitelepathic rapport. The last thing Jake needed was to be close to someone he couldn't touch for fear of a dead vampire's voyeurism!</p><p>In Jake's absence, while he used the M�bius Continuum to pursue and harass Luigi Castellano's Mediterranean-based drug-runners, E-Branch had tracked down Malinari and Vavara to the tiny Greek island of Krassos. This time, as distinct from the Australian operation, Trask's task force was a very small one, and politically and economically (even climatically, in an El Ni�o year), there were huge problems to be overcome. But with the help of a Greek friend of theirs from an earlier adventure--an Athenian police inspector called Manolis Papastamos--finally E-Branch located and burned Vavara's monastery aerie, while her deadspawn garden was dynamited and buried in a series of explosive attacks.</p><p>But at the same time there had been two major setbacks. In London, Ben Trask's newfound love of only a few days' duration, the telepath Millicent Cleary, had been kidnapped by Szwart and his minions down into his Roman temple dedicated to dark gods in a forgotten cavern deep under the city. And in Krassos, Liz Merrick had been taken by Vavara when that mistress of evil made her escape from the blazing monastery. It had looked like the end for both of these brave women. But:</p><p>In Sicily, where Jake had finally rid the world of Castellano and his organization--and in the process discovered why he had felt so driven by his vendetta: that this had been part of a task begun but left unfinished, even unremembered, by the original Necroscope--the new Necroscope "heard" Liz's desperate cry for help. Across all the many miles between them, Jake heard it. It was the rapport which existed between them, which had boosted Liz's developing telepathic talent.</p><p>But when Jake required Korath to show him the M�bius equations in order that he might use the Continuum to find Liz and rescue her...then Korath had sprung his t...</p></p><h2>ASPEN Adult Nutrition Support Core Curri</h2><p>Still in plastic, never been used!</p><p></p><h2>Uncoated Chips: Pantone Color Specifier</h2><p>one vol. only, 1.1c to 91c, 98% complete ,some chips missing, ringbinder copy</p><p></p><h2>Adventures of Reddy Fox</h2><p>Children will love hearing, and reading, about Reddy Fox and his adventures in the Green Meadow and Green Forest, such as when he first gets bold and then careless, why Granny Fox has to take care of him and how the other Green Forest little people help h</p><p>Thornton Waldo Burgess (1874 - 1965) was a conservationist and author of children&#39;s stories.

The "Dragnet" presented in MY NAME'S FRIDAY is not only the crisp, campy color television series that played from 1967 to 1970. It is also the radio series of 1949-1957 and the television series of 1951-1959, which became TV's best known, longest-running and most acclaimed police drama. <p>Here the narrative follows the ebb and flow of "Dragnet" from radio to television, detailing every awkward moment and production feature that refined the drama throughout the 1950's. From the beginning, Jack Webb had an idea of what the show should be, but it was an evolving idea, a refinement that MY NAME'S FRIDAY chronicles as the show matured from radio to television. Hayde goes beyond "just the facts" to offer readers a comprehensive look at the show that defined an entire genre. </p><p>Also included are program guides of the radio and television episodes, a collection of Sgt. Friday's most well-known speeches, and a glossary of police terms used in the series.</p>Nearly twenty years after his untimely passing, Jack Webb is mainly remembered as a stiff actor, an uninspired director, and the square, campy, all-too-verbose Sgt. Joe Friday of the "Dragnet" series produced during 1967-1970. Yet when this classic show made its original TV debut in 1951, Webb was hailed as a genius, and his directorial technique was studied and imitated. He was TV's first triple-threat man: Producer, Director, Star. He parlayed that success into his dream job as a motion picture director - and his first film, a 90-minute full-color "Dragnet" (1954), was a solid box office smash. Moreover, his penchant for tight close-ups, terse dialogue and suspenseful music is still a hallmark of television drama. <p>In writing this book, my goal was to illuminate the complete, true story of "Dragnet." Why did the LAPD approve releasing case files to a garden-variety radio actor? What were the circumstances by which "Dragnet" returned to television six years after its cancellation? And how does a genius turn into a joke? "MY NAME'S FRIDAY" unravels these mysteries and more in an entertaining book that is a must read not only for Jack Webb enthusiasts, but for all radio, television and pop culture fans.</p></p><h2>Shield and Sword: The United States Navy and the Persian Gulf War</h2><p><strong>Essential reading as part of the Chief of Naval Operation's Professional Reading Program</strong>!<br><p>Though not so well known as the land and air campaigns, the campaign at sea in the 1991 Gulf War was vital in subduing Saddam Hussein's invasion forces and driving them out of Kuwait. U.S. Navy surface ships and submarines launched hundreds of cruise missile attacks against Iraqi targets throughout the war, and carriers sent air strikes deep into enemy territory. The battleships <i>Missouri</i> and <i>Wisconsin</i> bombarded hostile targets while U.S. sailors joined U.S. Army and Royal Navy helicopter crews in additional actions. SEAL missions, global sealift actions, mine countermeasures, and operations in support of the economic embargo were still more contributing factors to the complex joint warfare effort.</p><br><p>Details of these naval operations are thoroughly documented and analyzed in this authoritative study, conducted by the Naval Historical Center and published in limited numbers in 1999. It is based on previously classified action and lessons-learned reports, interviews with participants, and studies conducted by the Center for Naval Analyses and the Department of Defense. The book includes candid evaluations of leadership effectiveness, interservice relations, and methods of command and control. It also analyses the effectiveness of various weapons and sensors, including the Tomahawk land-attack missile, the EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, the Aegis battle management system, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Capture of the city would give the Americans control of Canada &#x2013; a disaster for the British. The subsequent campaign involved a 350-mile trek across uninhabited wilderness, a desperate American attack on the city of Quebec that left one American general dead and another wounded, and a British counterattack that culminated in a brutal naval battle off Valcour Island on Lake Champlain.

Now, with <i>Organic Manifesto</i>, Maria Rodale, chairman of Rodale, sheds new light on the state of 21st century farming. She examines the unholy alliances that have formed between the chemical companies that produce fertilizer and genetically altered seeds, the agricultural educational system that is virtually subsidized by those same companies, and the government agencies in thrall to powerful lobbyists, all of which perpetuate dangerous farming practices and deliberate misconceptions about organic farming and foods. Interviews with government officials, doctors, scientists, and farmers from coast to coast bolster her position that chemical-free farming may be the single most effective tool we have to protect our environment and, even more important, our health.</p><p>Maria Rodale is the CEO and Chairman of Rodale Inc., the world's leading multimedia company with a focus on health, wellness, and the environment, and the largest independent book publisher in the United States.

Out of the blue my dad would say, "Let's go for a drive," and we'd all scramble into the station wagon. When the destination turned out to be the orchard, we would rush to the juice machine and push our paper cups under the spout to get a cup of cold, fresh cider.<br><br>The autumn air would be filled with the scent of fallen leaves and wisps of wood smoke, and we would always come home with a wooden bushel basket full of apples, or sometimes even two if we were going to make applesauce. None of us wore seat belts and, in fact, I doubt the car even had them--it was the 1960s. We headed home feeling lucky to live in a place where apples right from the tree were so delicious, so fresh, and so close by.<br><br>These were our good times. My Eden. My family lived right next door to my grandparents on a working farm where chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, and organic vegetables and fruits were raised. The fields were planted with hay and corn. At that time we knew the only way to get organic food was to grow it ourselves and so we did. And it was good.<br><br>Years pass, and now I'm driving my own kids to the local fair. In the intervening years, my grandfather died, having achieved iconic status in the hippie culture (although he himself was not one). My father, too, died, killed in a freak car accident while trying to launch an organic gardening magazine in Moscow. As I drive, I notice that the orchard has been turned into a housing development, and only a few gnarled old apple trees remain at the edges of the manicured lawns. I have often joked that Pennsylvania's biggest farm crop is houses, so while I am saddened to see a housing development there, I am not surprised. Nor, unfortunately, am I surprised when I read in the local newspaper that every one of the 800 water wells in that development tested positive for lead and arsenic. The soil is also contaminated, with levels more than 50 times higher than is deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The families who bought houses on Macintosh or Dumpling Drive, thinking they were getting their slice of the American dream, now are living an American nightmare.1<br><br>It's impossible not to feel for those poor families. Their children have a much higher risk of suffering reduced intelligence, behavioral problems, and health issues. Consider the young couples who thought they would be starting families and now find themselves unable to conceive,2 and may even be facing cancer treatments instead of fertility treatments. Consider the hard working people who might never be able to sell their houses. Perhaps you know other families in similar situations.<br><br>Now consider this: We are all in the same situation to varying degrees. We are all being poisoned, contaminated, sterilized, and eventually exterminated by the synthetic chemicals we have used for the last 100 years to grow our food and maintain our lawns, to make our lives easier and "cleaner" and our food "cheaper."<br><br>Most of us probably think our species' biggest problems, aside from the global economic collapse, have to do with energy and energy independence. The debate over the climate crisis and environmental destruction has been almost completely focused on energy usage--how we drive our cars, heat our homes, and power our affluent and well-lit lifestyles. We haven't yet made the full connection between how we grow our food and the impact it can have on our climate crisis and our health crisis.<br><br>The global economic upheaval in 2008 and 2009 has afforded us a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to rebuild and re-envision an economic model, a government, and a future that is based on what is right for people, the environment, and business. We can and must create a world that is more than sustainable, that is regenerative. Nature, under optimal circumstances (mainly, when we leave it alone) heals itself. Regeneration is necessary to heal the damage we have already done to ourselves and to our environment.<br><br>It is time to begin the process of healing.<br><br>WHY CARBON REALLY MATTERS<br><br>Over the last century we've all been subjected to an unprecedented chemical experiment. While there have been antivivisection movements around the world to protect animals from testing, I've never heard about a single protest to save our children from this vast experiment. Yet there is increasing and frightening evidence that agricultural and other industrial chemicals are causing significant and lasting health problems-- problems that will be hard to solve and take time to correct even if we start making changes today. The evidence is starting to pile up.<br><br>Do you know what the number one reason is for kids missing school these days? It's not colds or the normal sicknesses that all children go through during their lives. It's asthma.3 Asthma's prevalence increased by 75 percent from 1980 to 19944 (the last time it was officially measured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Thirty-four million Americans have been diagnosed with asthma, and worldwide the number has reached approximately 300 million. 5 You could say that it's getting harder and harder to breathe on this planet.<br><br>What does asthma have to do with carbon?<br><br>Let's think for a minute about the human body and its relationship with the planet. Breathing is fundamental to life. We can live a few weeks without food, a few days without water, forever without cars if we must. But take away our air or our capacity to breathe it in and we are dead in minutes.<br><br>We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide in an ongoing cycle. Researchers have determined that global warming or climate change is caused primarily by too much carbon dioxide being produced by cars, manufacturing, and other uses of fossil fuels. Our collective exhaling is exceeding the earth's capacity to process it back into air for us to breathe in.<br><br>Carbon, the building block of life,6 is one of the most abundant naturally occurring elements on earth--it's in coal and inside our bodies, it's in limestone and in every living thing (which is how scientists are able to use carbon dating to determine the age of artifacts and fossils), it's in oil and it's in the air, it's in wood and it's also in soil. In its densest form, carbon is a diamond. The very same element in a less compact form is charcoal or graphite.<br><br>Carbon molecules move all the time--and react readily with other elements, especially oxygen. When one carbon atom reacts with one oxygen atom, the result is carbon monoxide, which is both highly toxic and at the same time useful (it's the blue flame burning on your gas stove, for instance). The carbon monoxide reaction occurs most often when carbon is burned in an oxygen-starved environment, like a woodstove. We have all heard stories about people who went to sleep on a cold winter night but never awoke the next morning because their faulty heating systems--oxygen-deprived, carbon- burning combustion--killed them with carbon monoxide.<br><br>When one carbon atom merges with two oxygen atoms, the result is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is produced naturally by things like volcanoes and hot springs, but it also occurs when you burn carbon. Like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide is toxic in high concentrations and can cause dizziness, headaches, rapid breathing, confusion, palpitations, and at very high concentrations death.7<br><br>Oxygen is released into the air by plants through photosynthesis. Plants breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen, a fundamental reason that plants of all kinds are essential to our survival. Plants generate oxygen we need to survive. The earth doesn't have enough plants to breathe in and store all the carbon dioxide our activities have been producing and recycle it as fresh oxygen. So we either have to stop spewing out so much carbon dioxide or find ways to "sequester" it--hold it someplace. This is the conundrum we now face. This is the essence of our climate crisis.<br><br>There is no shortage of schemes and dreams to solve this problem--including making "biochar,"8 cap-and-trade programs,9 creating vast underground tanks to hold the carbon, or shooting it out of our atmosphere and into space.<br><br>But what if we are missing a major piece of the equation? Most discussion on global warming has focused on the energy issue, both because it's the most visible cause of carbon dioxide emissions and, more important, because it's where all the money and political power are concentrated. Oil, gasoline, "clean" coal, solar, wind, biofuel, and all that goes with those things (wars, power grids, automobile companies, bailouts, deals, lobbying, government appointments) have been hogging our attention. And so in our daily confusion, we just take for granted that we will always have food, comfortable lifestyles, cars, and climate-controlled homes.<br><br>We take it all for granted--just like breathing.<br><br>Now imagine for a minute that someone, maybe Bill Gates, has developed a nanotechnology for sequestering carbon (that is, taking the excess carbon dioxide that causes global warming from the air and holding it in a stable, safe form somewhere where it cannot do any damage to the atmosphere). Perhaps it is a technology that you put in the soil that will suck up all the carbon we have expelled into the air. Bill will set up a new business called Mycrosoft that is backed by venture capitalists and has an IPO scheduled for Year 2. People would be all over this like girls at a Jonas Brothers concert. Headlines in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal would herald this new technology as the savior of our environment. Warren Buffett would buy a piece of the business, for sure. Bill Gates would win a Nobel Prize. All the lucky investors would make a fortune.<br><br>The irony is that this cutting-edge, breakthrough technology already exists. It's just that nobody has figured out how to own it yet.<br><br>(Actually, it's just a matter of time until Monsanto figures out a way to make money from it. Monsanto has been hosting meetings of the Agricultural Carbon Sequestration Standard Committee, along with the USDA, to develop standards for "validating carbon offsets resulting from soil carbon sequestration of greenhouse gas emission reductions at the soil interface." In other words, it is trying to figure out how to make a business out of carbon sequestration in the soil. This process is facilitated by a company called Novecta, a joint venture of the Iowa and Illinois Corn Growers Associations that provides guidance on crop protection, "value enhanced crops," and help farmers understand their role in "producing product that is desired by the food, fuel, and industrial markets."10<br><br>These are smart people who are on to carbon sequestration and trying to get ahead of the market, the government, and the organic community in order to control it and make money from it. And they have billions of dollars at stake in doing so.)<br><br>What is this magical, superpowered natural nanotechnology?<br><br>Mycorrhizal fungi.<br><br>"Myco" means fungus, and "rrhizal" means roots. So Mycorrhizal fungi are literally fungi that grow on the roots of plants.<br><br>For more than two decades the Farming Systems Trial (FST) at the Rodale Institute has been studying what happens over time to plants and soil in both organic and synthetic-chemical farming systems. The most surprising finding of all has been that organically farmed soil stores carbon. A lot of carbon. So much, in fact, that if all the cultivated land in the world were farmed organically it would immediately reduce our climate crisis significantly. "These fungi actually build our soil and its health and contribute to taking greenhouse gases out of the air--counteracting global warming to boot," says Paul Hepperly, PhD, a Fulbright scholar and former senior scientist at the Rodale Institute.<br><br>Conversely, soil farmed using synthetic-chemical or "conventional" methods has very little ability to keep or build vital supplies of carbon in the soil. This is not surprising, since farmers often apply fungicides as well as chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals are meant to kill. As a result of using these chemicals, a farmer is left with debilitated soil that has weakened microbial life, a compromised structure, and a significantly impaired ability to withstand the stresses of drought and flood.<br><br>The fact that we haven't noticed these little helpful creatures before shouldn't surprise us. We prefer our nature in the macro--the postcard vistas and views. When it comes to the micro, we'd rather not look or know. We know more about outer space than we do about the ground we live on, about the soil that sustains us. In general we don't care to think too much about soil. Frankly, it's not sexy. In its verb form, it's a synonym for something that's dirty or ruined. Our most regular contact with soil probably occurs when it gets tracked into the house on muddy shoes. Then we get out the bucket and mop and fill it with fresh meadow-scented antibacterial cleaners to purify our homes and protect our families.<br><br>In the 1950s, a promotional brochure for DuPont Farm Chemicals trumpeted "Man against the soil: The story of man in his rise from savagery to civilization is the story of his struggle to wrest his food from the soil." Soil is our enemy?<br><br>Television commercials for cleaning products show magnified images of little bacterial villains who are out to get us, making us paranoid and afraid. And yet, according to Lynn Bry, MD, PhD, clinical fellow of pathology at Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, if all the germs and bacteria in our bodies (and all around us) were eliminated, we would be dead within 2 weeks.11 Why, then, are we so intent on wiping them out?<br><br>Suspend your fear of dirt and all those things we can't see with our own eyes for a minute.<br><br>What we call "soil" is a living thing. Just one tablespoon of soil can contain up to 10 billion microbes--that's one and a half times the total human population. We are learning more each day about what goes on in that soil. The discoveries are surprising--and incredibly important.<br><br>Right now, soil scientists understand less than 1 percent of all the living things in the soil. But soil is more like us than like plants because the microbes in it breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Healthy, organic soil also stores massive quantities of carbon and holds it tightly, just like a tree holds on to and stores carbon in its trunk and limbs (which is why all of our forests, including the rain forests, are so important to our survival).<br><br>Think about this for a minute.</p><h2>Bach - Partitas For The Piano (Samwise Music For Piano)</h2><p>Bach's six Partitas for the Harpsichord or Piano, BWV 825-830.

The occasion was the mission of Lord Macartney, sent by the British crown and sponsored by the East India Company, to the court of the Qianlong emperor. <i>Cherishing Men from Afar</i> looks at the initial confrontation between these two empires from a historical perspective informed by the insights of contemporary postcolonial criticism and cultural studies.<br>The history of this encounter, like that of most colonial and imperial encounters, has traditionally been told from the Europeans&#x2019; point of view. In this book, James L. Hevia consults Chinese sources&#x2014;many previously untranslated&#x2014;for a broader sense of what Qing court officials understood; and considers these documents in light of a sophisticated anthropological understanding of Qing ritual processes and expectations. He also reexamines the more familiar British accounts in the context of recent critiques of orientalism and work on the development of the bourgeois subject. Hevia&#x2019;s reading of these sources reveals the logics of two discrete imperial formations, not so much impaired by the cultural misunderstandings that have historically been attributed to their meeting, but animated by differing ideas about constructing relations of sovereignty and power. His examination of Chinese and English-language scholarly treatments of this event, both historical and contemporary, sheds new light on the place of the Macartney mission in the dynamics of colonial and imperial encounters.<br></p><p>&#34;James Hevia persuasively suggests a whole new way of viewing not just the Macartney embassy but the entire subject of Sino-Western interaction from the eighteenth century to the present. &#34;Cherishing Men from Afar &#34;deserves to be read by the widest spectrum of historians.&#34;--Paul A.

Intense, idealistic, personal, his is the poetry of youth. His brief, impetuous life aroused great controversy, and, like Byron, he lives on outside his verse.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shelley&#x2019;s work has been criticized for its undisciplined emotionalism. But essentially he was a poet of ideas, and in his search for truth and original human perfection, Shelley was inspired as much by the Greek poets and philosophers, particularly Plato, as by the radicalism of his own age. Above all, his great gift was his lyricism, and his verse comes as near to music as poetry can. As the poet Kathleen Raine said, &#x201c;In his art if not in his life, Shelley was able to soar, to give expression to those dreams and visions which, continually broken by reality, are inextinguishable in the human spirit.&#x201d;</p><p>Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), perhaps the most intellectually adventurous of the great Romantic poets, personified the richly various- and contradictory- energies of his time. A classicist, a headlong visionary, a social radical, and a poet of serene artistry with a lyric touch second to none, Shelley gave voice to English romanticism&#39;s deepest aspirations.Adonais<br> The Aziola<br> Chorus (1)<br> Chorus (2)<br> Chorus Of Spirits Of The Mind<br> The Cloud<br> The Earth<br> England In 1819<br> Epipsychidion<br> Fragment (1)<br> Hymn To Intellectual Beauty<br> The Indian Serenade<br> Letter To Maria Gisborne<br> Lines (1)<br> Lines Written Among The Euganean Hills<br> Lines Written On Hearing The News Of The Death Of Napoleon<br> Love's Philosophy<br> The Mask Of Anarchy; Written On Occasion Of Massacre At Manchester<br> Mont Blanc; Lines Written In The Vale Of Chamouni<br> Mutability (2)<br> O World, O Life, O Time<br> Ode To The West Wind<br> Ozymandias<br> Part The Fifth: Grace<br> Part The Fourth: Sin<br> Part The Third: Hell<br> Prometheus [or Asia]<br> Song<br> Song Of Appolo<br> The Song Of Pan<br> Song To The Men Of England<br> Spirit Of The Hour<br> Stanzas Written In Dejection, Near Naples<br> There Was A Poet, Whose Untimely Tomb<br> To - (5)<br> To A Skylark<br> To Jane: Keen Stars<br> To Jane: The Recollection<br> To Night<br> To The Lord Chancellor<br> To The Moon (1)<br> The Triumph Of Life<br> Verses Written On Receiving A Celandine In A Letter<br> The Waning Moon<br> -- <i>Table of Poems from Poem Finder�</i></p><h2>Sufferings of Prince Sternenhoch</h2><p>THE SUFFERINGS OF PRINCE STERNENHOCH is the only full-length work of fiction Klima prepared for publication during his lifetime, and it can be considered a summation of his philosophy. In a series of journal entries, the book chronicles the descent into madness of Prince Sternenhoch, the German Empire1s foremost aristocrat and favorite of the Kaiser. Having become the "lowliest worm" at the hands of his deceased wife Helga, the Queen of Hells, he eventually attains an ultimate state of bliss and salvation. Klima uses dark humor to explore the paradoxical nature of pure spirituality in scenes that are comically grostesque and often obscene. This volume also includes his notorious essay "My Autobiography." Though Klima1s work has been translated into many European languages, this is the first book of his to appear in English. Jan Nemec's film based on the novel, In the Flames of Royal Love, is set for general world-wide DVD release the end of 2007.<br><br>Translated from the Czech by Carleton Bulkin.</p><p>Ladislav Klima is considered to be one of the most important Czech philosophers of the 20th century, and arguably the greatest of the prewar era. His work has influenced artists of all stripes, most notably Bohumil Hrabal and the Plastic People of the Universe. Drawing his greatest inspiration from Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, Klima developed his conception of will and radical subjectivism in numerous essays, aphorisms, tracts, prose works, and plays, and though his work was banned by both the communists and Nazis, underground editions were widely circulated.Despite the subtitle, this first English-language publication by Klima (1878-1928), a noted Czech philosopher, has little to offer readers of Stephen King. It is more screed than story, ostensibly the tale of a mad German prince who marries a completely appalling woman, who murders her father and infant before trysting with a filthy peasant who flogs her bloody while enduring her windy rants about her own abused, abusive and completely anti-social upbringing. Thus stimulated, the prince's "romance" continues well after his wife's apparent death. There's much of the whip in all this, a great fascination with all things perverse, but nothing that makes any of the characters more than bizarre caricatures. Much scabrous wit and the hallucinatory nature of events leave the reader uncertain about taking anything seriously. Appended is the author's autobiography, in which he turns out to be as pathological as any of his characters, a genuine transgressive in the manner of de Sade. Either our legs are being pulled, or this a fine example of the Ambrose Bierce dictum that the philosopher specializes in giving advice to people who are happier than he is. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chef Anne Mahle started as a mess cook on one of the windjammers and quickly developed a passion for cooking. She has spend the last 15 years working and learning, graduating from mess cook to head cook on the windjammers to private chef on a Caribbean yacht.

Riggin. Her love of cooking is expressed all summer long in the healthy, classic, country-style food she cooks for their summer guests. Anne is also a popular newspaper columnist, which gives her another outlet for sharing her passion for delicious food."The meals...were home-style delights...cooked to caramelized perfection in the belly of the wood stove." -- <i>Alison DaRosa, San Diego Union Tribune</i><br><br>&#x201c;A cozy eatery gourmets will want to keep secret."

As musicians in the Second Kansas Infantry, they make a long and difficult march into Missouri, where they encounter General McCulloch's Missouri Guard at the arduous Battle of Wilson's Creek. Mike is wounded and left for dead; Todd is brutally killed. Mike looks on in agony while a man takes an heirloom pocket watch from his friend's body-he'd promised Todd he'd return it to his sister if anything ever happened to him. He is rescued by a Confederate soldier-someone he'd known on the orphan train-and eventually rejoins his regiment and has several adventures and close calls with Confederate sympathizers along the way. His overriding mission, however, is to retrieve Todd's watch. Nixon writes energetically and maintains an aura of adventure and danger. She clearly portrays the horrors of war, and the particular agony of this war. Her characters are finely drawn and multifaceted, the plot is lively, and the details are well chosen.

More than 200 years have gone by since the ship left England after dreadful weather kept it harbored for months, on its mission to transport breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies. The mutiny in Tahiti left the mutineers scattered about the paradisiacal islands and found Bligh and 18 of his loyal crew members set adrift in a 23-foot open boat. Bligh, who'd served as Capt. James Cook's sailing master, fantastically maneuvered the crew on a 48-day, 3,600-mile journey to safety. Caroline Alexander, author of <i>The Endurance</i>, is never in over her head even when weaving together densely twisting narratives, or explaining the unwritten rules of the Royal Navy, of the complexities of class and hierarchy that impelled much of what happened aboard the Bounty. The book centers far more on the effort to round up the mutineers than the actual mutiny itself. The book is enlivened by the colorful commentary of the crew members themselves, gleaned from letters and court documents. Alexander does us all the favor of presenting Bligh the way he was understood and received in his day--as a brilliant navigator who, when placed in context, was not a brutal task-master at all. She roots the tyrannical figure we know so well from the movies on the last-ditch efforts of one well-connected crew member to save his own hide from hanging. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i>Caroline Alexander was born in Florida, of British parents, and has lived in Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. She studied Philosophy and Theology at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and has a doctorate in Classics from Columbia University.

On the agenda, two tantalizing, unsolved cases of ghostly terror. </blockquote> <p> <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and unsurpassed mater of suspense Barbara Michaels delivers a fireside page-turner in the grand tradition with her latest book, <em> Other Worlds.</em> </p><p> The smoky room glows with a mix of cigars, brandy, and genius. Those present include Harry Houdini, king of illusion; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, father of the modern detective novel; Dr. Nandor Fodor, a psychoanalyst of international acclaim; and an elegant writer who can rival them all with her sleuthing talent. </p><p> These maters of mystery put their minds to a pair of gripping stories--of families beset by poltergeistly pranks and bewitched by inexplicable horrors. Gripping puzzles, yes, but the terror is all too vicious and all too real. </p><p> </p><blockquote> In the hallows of Tennessee, a family is threatened by a dire spirit whose predictions of despair and death come frighteningly true. <p> In a small Connecticut town, a newly married widow and her children move into her second husband's home to find their lives possessed by an unimaginable demon.</p></blockquote><p> For the gathering at the club, a brilliant battle of wits is at hand. Were these villains phantoms from beyond or evildoers of flesh and blood? Each expert has a theory. Which of them is correct? </p><p> Whether writing as Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters, this author is a master chef crafting richly atmospheric, suspense-filled delights. <em>Other Worlds</em> is an up-all-nighter, guaranteed to still haunt in the morning--a tale as chilling by daylight as it is by darkness.</p></p><p>Barbara Michaels (who also writes as Mystery Grandmaster Elizabeth Peters) is known for cozy romantic suspense, but <i>Other Worlds</i> is indeed another world of fiction for her. Set "outside time and space, in the realm of the imagination," the book is an all-star team meeting among several of the most famous dabblers in the world of the occult. These include American magician Harry Houdini, Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle, Nandor Fodor (former director of the International Institute for Psychical Research), Frank Podmore of the Society for Psychical Research, and a few other guests over two nights. Michaels establishes the purpose of their gathering in a brief opening passage, an exchange between Doyle and Podmore: "During our evenings together we enjoy a busman's holiday, applying our combined expertise to the investigation of famous cases that have never been satisfactorily explained. Sometimes we agree on a solution; more often we agree to disagree." On the two evening meetings recorded in this volume, the group addresses two ghost tales. The first narrative is of the Bell Witch, a ghost that haunted the Bell family for several years in 19th-century Tennessee. The second details the 1850 invasion of the Phelps family of Stratford, Connecticut, by demonic forces. In both cases, the story is followed by the commentaries of the guests, as each of them tries to explain away or justify the occult elements. <p> The collection has merit as a diversion for fans of classic ghost tales, and it has much the flavor of Poe and Hawthorne's stories of the supernatural. But, ultimately, the two narratives do not hold up well in their frame. Since, from the start, Michaels declares that the meetings among Houdini et al. are to be regarded as imaginary, much of the suspense is lost; then, the format (a story followed by analysis and criticism) undermines the suspense further as the reader witnesses the plot being pulled apart and rewritten by her various narrators. Fans of Michaels's other work may be disappointed by the lack of romance here, too (though Betsy Bell's ill-fated first love is a centerpiece of the Bell Witch tale). Nonetheless, Michaels's experiment in ghost narratives is an interesting one, and it is a pleasure to watch her assume the voices of these famous male figures in their antiquated, smoke-filled, gentleman's club of dreams. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>Elizabeth Peters (writing as Barbara Michaels) was born and brought up in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago's famed Oriental Institute. Peters was named Grandmaster at the inaugural Anthony Awards in 1986, Grandmaster by the Mystery Writers of America at the Edgar� Awards in 1998, and given The Lifetime Achievement Award at Malice Domestic in 2003.

Weeks, H-Net Reviews</p><p>"The essays are impressive in terms of research conceptualization, and analysis." &#x2015;Slavic Review</p><p>Presenting the results of new research and fresh approaches, the historians whose work is highlighted here seek to extend new thinking about the way imperial Russian history is studied and taught. Populating their essays are a varied lot of ordinary Russians of the 18th and 19th centuries, from a luxury-loving merchant and his extended family to reform-minded clerics and soldiers on the frontier. In contrast to much of traditional historical writing on Imperial Russia, which focused heavily on the causes of its demise, the contributors to this volume investigate the people and institutions that kept Imperial Russia functioning over a long period of time. </p></p><p>A Selection of the History Book Club<p>Jane Burbank is Professor of History at the University of Michigan and author of Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism.<br>David L.

L'Engle was named the 1998 recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards award, honoring her lifetime contribution in writing for teens.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle was born in 1918 in New York City, late in her parents' lives,an only child growing up in an adult world. Her father was a journalist who had been a foreign correspondent, and although he suffered from mustard gas poisoning in World War I, his work still took him abroad a great deal. Her mother was a musician; the house was filled with her parents' friends: artists, writers, and musicians. "Their lives were very full and they didn't really have time for a child," she says. "So I turned to writing to amuse myself."<br><br>When she was 12, Ms. L'Engle moved with her family to the French Alps in search of purer air for her father's lungs. She was sent to an English boarding school --"dreadful," she says. When she was 14, her family returned to America and she went to boarding school once again, Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina--which she loved. When she was 17, her father died.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle spent the next four years at Smith College. After graduating cum laude, she and an assortment of friends moved to an apartment in Greenwich Village. "I still wanted to be a writer; I always wanted to be a writer, but I had to pay the bills, so I went to work in the theater," she says.<br><br>Touring as an actress seems to have been a catalyst for her. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. "The surrounding area was real dairy farmland then, and very rural. Some of the children had never seen books when they began their first year of school," she remembers. The Franklins raised three children--Josephine, Maria, and Bion. Ms. L'Engle's first book in the Austin quintet, <i>Meet the Austins,</i> an ALA Notable Children's Book, has strong parallels with her life in the country. But she says, "I identify with Vicky rather than with Mrs. Austin, since I share all of Vicky's insecurities, enthusiasms, and times of sadness and growth."<br><br>When, after a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York, Ms. L'Engle rejoiced. "In some ways, I was back in the real world." Mr. Franklin resumed acting, and became well known as Dr. Charles Tyler in the television series <i>All My Children.</i> <i>Two-Part Invention</i> is Ms. L'Engle's touching and critically acclaimed story of their long and loving marriage. <br><br>The Time quintet--<i>A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters,</i> and <i>An Acceptable Time</i>--are among her most famous books, but it took years to get a publisher to accept <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i> "Every major publisher turned it down. No one knew what to do with it," she says. When Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux finally accepted the manuscript, she insisted that they publish it as a children's book. It was the beginning of their children's list."<br><br>Today, Ms. L'Engle lives in New York City and Connecticut, writing at home and at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where she is variously the librarian and the writer-in-residence. "It depends from day-to-day on what they want to call me. I do keep the library collection--largely theology, philosophy, a lot of good reference books--open on a volunteer basis."<br><b>Author Fun Facts<br><br></b><i>Born<br></i>November 29 in New York City<br><br><i>Education<br></i>Smith College, The New School, Columbia University<br><br><i>Currently lives<br></i>New York City and Connecticut<br><br><i>Fun Jobs<br></i>Librarian, actress<br><br><i>Favorite...<br></i>...hobbies: traveling, reading, playing the piano, and cooking<br><b>A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"</b>I wrote my first story when I was 5. It was about a little G-R-U-L, because that&#x2019;s how I spelled &#x201c;girl&#x201d; when I was 5. I wrote because I wanted to know what everything was about. My father, before I was born, had been gassed in the first World War, and I wanted to know why there wer wars, why people hurt each other, why we couldn&#x2019;t get along together, and what made people tick. That&#x2019;s why I started to write stories.<br><br>The books I read most as a child were by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who&#x2019;s best known for her Anne of Green Gables stories, but I also liked Emily of New Moon. Emily was an only child, as I was. Emily lived on an island, as did I. Although Manhattan Island and Prince Edward Island are not very much alike, they are still islands. Emily&#x2019;s father was dying of bad lungs, and so was mine. Emily had some dreadful relative, and so did I. She had a hard time in school, and she also understood that there&#x2019;s more to life than just the things that can be explained by encyclopedias and facts. Facts alone are not adequate. I love Emily. I also read E. Nesbit, who was a nineteenth-century writer of fantasies and family stories, and I read fairy tales and the myths of all countries. And anything I could get my hands on.<br><br>As an adult, I like to read fiction. I really enjoy good murder mystery writers, usually women, frequently English, because they have a sense of what the human soul is about and why people do dark and terrible things. I also read quite a lot in the area of particle physics and quantum mechanics, because this is theology. This is about the nature of being. This is what life is all about. I try to read as widely as I possibly can.<br><br>I wrote <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> when we were living in a small dairy farm village in New England. I had three small children to raise, and life was not easy. We lost four of our closest friends within two years by death--that&#x2019;s a lot of death statistically. And I really wasn&#x2019;t finding the answers to my big questions in the logical places. So, at the time I discovered the world of particle physics. I discovered Einstein and relativity. I read a book of Einstein&#x2019;s, in which he said that anyone who&#x2019;s not lost in rapturous awe at the power and glory of the mind behind the universe is as good as a burnt-out candle. And I thought, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve found my theologian, what a wonderful thing.&#x201d; I began to read more in that area. <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> came out of these questions, and out of my discovery of the post-utopian sciences, which knocked everything we knew about science for a loop.<br><br><i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was almost never published. You can&#x2019;t name a major publisher who didn&#x2019;t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I&#x2019;d read to them at night what I&#x2019;d written during the day, and they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Ooh, mother, go back to the typewriter!&#x201d; <i>A Wrinkle in Time&#x201d; </i>had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn&#x2019;t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don&#x2019;t find, or didn&#x2019;t at that time, in children&#x2019;s books. When we&#x2019;d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up. Then my mother was visiting for Christmas, and I gave her a tea party for some of her old friends. One of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by John Farrar, of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, which at that time did not have a juvenile list. She insisted that I meet John any how, and I went down with my battered manuscript. John had read my first novel and liked it, and read this book and loved it. That&#x2019;s how it happened.<br><br>The most asked question that I generally receive is, &#x201c;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s very easily answered. I tell a story about Johann Sebastian Bach when he was an old man. A student asked him, &#x201c;Papa Bach, where do you get the ideas for all of these melodies?&#x201d; And the old man said, &#x201c;Why, when I get up in the morning, it&#x2019;s all I can do not to trip over them.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how ideas are; they&#x2019;re just everywhere. I think the least asked question is one that I got in Japan. This little girl held up her hand and said, &#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; In Japan, I am very tall.<br><br>I get over one hundred letters a week. There are always letters that stand out. There was one from a 12-year-old girl in North Carolina who wrote me many years ago, saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jewish and most of my friends are Christian. My Christian friends told me only Christians can be saved. What do you think? Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d; Well, we corresponded for about twenty years. I suggested that she go back to read some of the great Jewish writers to find out about her own tradition. Another letter asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re studying the crusades in school. Can there be such a thing as a Holy War? Is war ever right?&#x201d; I mean, kids don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions. And it&#x2019;s a great honor to have the kids say, &#x201c;Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>The questions are not always about the books. They&#x2019;re sometimes about the deepest issues of life. &#x201c;Why did my parents put my grandmother in a nursing home?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one that has come up several times. The letters are enlightening, particularly when t...Troubling a Star <br> One <i>The iceberg was not a large one, but it was big enough so that the seal and I were not crowded, and I was grateful for that. The seal was asleep after its night of hunting. It was a crab-eater seal, and crab eaters live on krill, not crab, and as far as I know do not eat people. I willed it to stay asleep and not even notice that Vicky Austin was sharing its iceberg, which was floating majestically in the dark and icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean, or that my heart was beating wildly with terror.</i> <i>The sun was out and the sky was high and blue and cloudless. I was shivering uncontrollably despite my long winter underwear, turtleneck, heavy sweater, bright red parka. I had on lined blue jeans with yellow waterproof pants over them. I wore three pairs of socks under green rubber boots. I was highly visible--if there had been anyone around to see me.</i> <i>I tried to control my panic, to assess my situation. Several things could happen. I could be missed and someone would come for me. Thatwas my brightest hope. But I had to face the possibility that nobody would find me in this vast space, and that I would ultimately freeze to death. Or the iceberg might overturn, as they sometimes do, and I would be plunged into the water and die quickly from hypothermia.</i> <i>I looked around me in all directions. There were dozens more icebergs, many with seals on them. There was a hunched shadow of land on one horizon. No sign of human life. In the water I saw three penguins flashing by, heading for land. Penguins fly in the water, rather than in air. I watched them until I could not see them any longer.</i> <i>They say that drowning people relive their entire lives in a flash. I'd been on the iceberg only a few minutes, long enough to be terrified, but not long enough to despair. That would come later.</i> &nbsp; <br> How did I get to be on an iceberg in Antarctic waters in January, which is summer--but even summer is cold in that land of unremitting ice. It went back a few months to those last weeks of summer before school starts. I was still fifteen then, feeling lost and alien, though I had yet to learn what being truly alien feels like. My family and I had come home to our little village of Thornhill, after a year away. My adored grandfather was dead. The only really good thing in my life was that I'd see Adam soon, Adam Eddington, who'd had a summer job in the marine biology lab with my older brother, John. Adam and I had become friends during the summer, and if the friendship meant more to me than it did to Adam, well, I would just have to live with that. I knew that some of the time I was only John's kid sister in Adam's eyes, but there were other times when it was a lot more than that. In another week John would be going back to M.I.T., and Suzy and I would be in the regional high school, Suzy as an eighth-grader, and I'd be starting my junior year. Our little brother, Rob, would still be in the village school. It all should have been normal and okay, but I'd been away for a year and I'd grown and changed, and even before school started I felt I no longer belonged. So when Adam called from New York to say he was spending a weekend with his Aunt Serena in nearby Clovenford before flying to California to college and would it be all right if he came for dinner on Friday, it was as though the sun had suddenly come out after a foggy day. He arrived around six-thirty, driving up in an old and beautiful Bentley, much to John's envy. I was sorting laundry, one of my least favorite chores, but I kept on folding clothes, rather than rushing out to join John and Rob, who were admiring the great old car. The evening was warm, and I had on my best shorts and a clean blouse which I'd actually ironed. I'd have dressed up more than that, but I knew Suzy would be at me. My little sister and I do not always see eye to eye. When Adam finally came in, he kissed me, or would have, if Mr. Rochester, our old Great Dane, hadn't been all over him, trying to jump up on him, wagging his tail, greeting Adam with all kinds of special affection. Adam managed to shove him down in a gentle sort of way, and kissed me again. But then he kissed my mother and Suzy, too. Then everybody talked at once, more or less, until my father came home from admitting a patient to the hospital. And finally we were all sitting around the dinner table, and that felt right and good. When everybody had been served, Adam said, "Hey, I have terrific news." We all looked at him. "I've been given a grant to go to Antarctica next semester." "You mean now?" Suzy asked. "No, not this semester. Next semester, in December." Our father raised his eyebrows questioningly. "Why Antarctica?" Adam grinned at him. "Well, Dr. Austin, I <i>am</i> a marine-biology major, and it's a major opportunity. I'll be working at LeNoir, one of the small U.S. stations." "I thought you were into starfish and dolphins," Suzy said. "There'll probably be a few of those at Eddington Point, where the station is, but mostly I'll be working with penguins." Mother asked, "Eddington Point?" Adam grinned again. "Actually, it's named after my uncle. He's probably the reason I'm a marine biologist. He made a couple of expeditions to Antarctica, and he died in an accident while he was out there." "Are you named after him?" Suzy asked. "Yup. Actually, I'm Adam III. My great-uncle, the banker, was Adam I. Adam Eddington, the marine biologist, was Adam II. And I'm Adam III. Listen, Vicky, John's coming over in the morning, but how about if I pick you up in the afternoon, maybe a little before four, and take you to Clovenford to meet my Aunt Serena? I really think you two would like each other." "Sure," I said. "I'd love to." I'd love to do anything with Adam. My father smiled at him. "Your Aunt Serena is one of my patients, and one of my favorite ones. I agree with you, Vicky will enjoy her." "And she'll enjoy Vicky." "They'll be good for each other," my father said. But if I'd never met Aunt Serena--if I'd never read Adam II's diary and found his letters-- Wait, Vicky. It's no good hindsighting. &nbsp; <br> After dinner Adam said he had to get on back to Clovenford to Aunt Serena, who was very old and retired early, and John and I went out to the garage to wave him off, with Mr. Rochester at our heels. Waving people off is a sort of tradition in our family. Before he got into the Bentley, Adam put his arm about my waist. "I know you miss your grandfather, Vicky." "Yeah. A lot." "He was a special person. One reason I want you to meet Aunt Serena is that she reminds me of your grandfather. She's an amazing old lady." "I look forward to it." I thought he might kiss me goodbye, but John was right there. "Good night, you two," Adam said. "It's been a great evening." "See you tomorrow," I said, trying to sound casual. "Sure. See you." I watched after his car as he drove down the road, and John went around the corner of the house to get Rochester. I started to go after them, but stopped and looked up at thesky, crisp and clear and full of stars. I was home, in the place where I had been born and grown up, and I responded to the beauty of the night sky and the great old maples and oaks, and I was lonely, a kind of loneliness that hurt like a toothache. I shook myself and headed back to the house. I was going to see Adam the next day. Wasn't that enough? &nbsp; <br> He came for me a little before three-thirty, and I was ready and waiting. I'd put on a flowered cotton skirt and another clean cotton blouse, much as I hate ironing. Mother asked Adam if he'd like to stay for dinner again when he brought me home, and he said he'd enjoy that. He and John had had lunch with Aunt Serena, and she was usually tired by evening and wanted to eat quietly and go to bed. He'd have to double-check with the chauffeur that it was all right to use the car. I'd forgotten that a world with people who had chauffeurs still existed. But there's a section of Clovenford that's old and rich, with great nineteenth-century mansions and people who actually have servant problems. Thornhill is older than Clovenford. Our house was built in the middle of the eighteenth century, and it sags comfortably, all the boards slanting toward the big central chimney. One problem my mother's never had is a servant problem. "See you later, then," Mother said, and Adam and I went out through the kitchen door and the garage. "You'll like my Aunt Serena--great-aunt--" Adam said. "She's ninety and occasionally gets a little absentminded, but mostly she's terrific and interested in all kinds of things." It was a gorgeous, pre-autumn day. Everything was still green, a bit dusty, because we needed rain. The roadsides were yellow with goldenrod, and occasionally a maple would be tipped with red or orange. We drove downhill, across the river, and then back up into the hills again. We passed the road to the hospital where my father's on the staff, and turned onto a wide street with houses set far back, and green lawns carefully manicured. "Elm Street," Adam said. "No elms, of course." "Lots of maples, though," I said. "These are beautiful ones. Suzy's passionate about the way we aren't taking care of the trees on our planet--you know Suzy." "She's right," Adam said, "though we didn't exactly cause Dutch elm disease. Here we are." Adam's Aunt Serena's house was large, white with black shutters, and a widow's walk. Adam stopped the car in front of a picket fence with a wrought-iron gate. The gateposts were topped with carved pineapples. "The sign of hospitality," Adam said, "though I'm not sure where that symbol comes from. You'll find Aunt Ser...</p><h2>199 Things on the Farm</h2><p>This varied picture reference book contains 199 individual items found around farms.

Love was a political weapon he wielded cunningly and ruthlessly in his private war against enemies in the forum. Genius, general, patrician, Gaius Julius Caesar was history. His wives bought him influence. He sacrificed his beloved daughter on the altar of ambition. He burned for the cold-hearted mistress he could never dare trust. Caesar's women all knew�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and feared�&#x20ac;&#x201d;his power. He adored them, used them, destroyed them on his irresistible rise to prominence. And one of them would seal his fate. </p></p><p><p>Colleen McCullough is the author of <em>The Thorn Birds, Tim, An Indecent Obsession, A Creed for the Third Millennium, The Ladies of Missalonghi, The First Man in Rome, The Grass Crown, Fortune's Favorites, Caesar's Women, Caesar</em>, and other novels. She lives with her husband on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.</p>Senator and debtor, general and seducer, orator and would-be world conqueror, Julius Caesar, as depicted in this fourth installment (after Fortune's Favorites) in McCullough's epic re-creation of ancient Rome, is both a force of nature and something of a momma's boy. He worships his sophisticated mother Aurelia, "a fount of experience and a mine of common sense," while dismissing as "not important" his "expensive, idle, and monumentally silly" second wife, Pompeia. Its title notwithstanding, this marvelously researched and detailed novel focuses on traditional male pursuits-political intrigue, war, conquest-in the corruption-riddled late Roman republic even as it elucidates the behind-the-scenes influence of women in a repressively patriarchal society. Caesar, though tenderly loving and protective toward his daughter, Julia, pledges her as a child to the adolescent Brutus, with whose mother-the cruel, scheming Servilia-the future dictator of Rome has a purely sexual affair. Years later, Caesar cancels the betrothal in order to use his blossoming daughter as bait to forge a political alliance with the commander of the Roman legions. Meanwhile, Cicero, Caesar's main rival, is portrayed as an incurable vacillator and social climber who displays scant gratitude toward his "sour" and "ugly" wife, Terentia, despite her foiling a conspiracy against his life. With great brio, and ample attention to Roman customs and rites, as well as to the religious, sexual and social institutions of the day, including slavery, McCullough captures the driven, passionate soul of ancient Rome.

In 1923, a girl named Flory is born into the Altaras family<br> in Bosnia. She loves Ladino, music, and the harmoniku (accordion) given to her by her nona<br> (grandmother).

Born in Bosnia to a Sephardic fam�i�ly in 1923, Jago�da escaped the ter�rors of the World War II and went on to ded�i�cate her life to pre�serv�ing and pre�sent�ing the tra�di�tions of her peo�ple. Levy&#x2019;s impas�sioned text and Wimmer&#x2019;s lav�ish pic�tures invite read�ers to learn more about the beau�ty of Sephardic cul�ture through the sto�ry of Jagoda&#x2019;s coura�geous life journey.</p> <p>The 'key' of the title has a dou�ble mean�ing. Levy begins the sto�ry long before Jagoda&#x2019;s birth in Spain, or Al-Andalus, the Ara�bic name for the Iber�ian Penin�su�la dur�ing the Ear�ly Mid�dle Ages. Many years of rel�a�tive�ly peace�ful coex�is�tence between Mus�lims, Chris�tians, and Jews end�ed in 1492, when the Span�ish monar�chy expelled non-Chris�tians, includ�ing Jagoda&#x2019;s ances�tors. The Altaras fam�i�ly left with two parts of their lega�cy: the small key to their Span�ish house, and the great and unfor�get�table key of their lan�guage. Levy presents the his�tor�i�cal mate�r�i�al in an engag�ing way, con�vey�ing to young read�ers the most impor�tant events after the Altaras found a new home in Bosnia. Through�out the book, select�ed pages end with a sim�u�lat�ed curl upwards and a date print�ed in large font, pro�vid�ing a time�line for the narrative.</p> <p>Like Yid�dish, which has Ger�man�ic gram�mar but many words incor�po�rat�ed from Hebrew and oth�er lan�guages, Ladi�no is root�ed in medieval Span�ish, with vocab�u�lary bor�rowed from the lands where the Sephardim set�tled, as well as from Hebrew and Ara�ma�ic. Levy&#x2019;s descrip�tion of the Sephardim&#x2019;s trans�plant�ed world is joy�ous and rich, but not exot�ic. Flo�ry grows up in a musi�cal fam�i�ly which, cen�turies after being forced out of Spain, still strong�ly iden�ti�fies with its past. The book&#x2019;s text and pic�tures bring dai�ly activ�i�ties to life, from rit�u�al prac�tices to warm social inter�ac�tions with Flory&#x2019;s friends and neigh�bors. When a Nazi pup�pet r�gime takes over Croa�t�ia, where her fam�i�ly had moved, Flory&#x2019;s world of secure con�nec�tions is shat�tered. Levy recounts Flory&#x2019;s per�ilous escape with ten�sion but not ter�ror, and Wimmer&#x2019;s image of a young Jew�ish girl on a crowd�ed train, serene�ly play�ing the accor�dion with eyes closed, express�es her strength. This is a book which shows the dan�ger�ous real�i�ties of Jew�ish his�to�ry in a way which chil�dren can process.<br> <br> The book con�cludes with Flory&#x2019;s suc�cess�ful career, open�ing her cul�ture to oth�ers with the key of art and faith�ful�ness to her past. There is a brief sec�tion doc�u�ment�ing her hon�ors and giv�ing more infor�ma�tion about her life.

A descendant of the Altaras family forced to leave Spain during the Inquisition, Flory and her family must now escape from the Balkans during World War II. Crucial to the story of the Altaras' 16th-century exodus are the two symbols of their heritage: a key for their original home in Spain and Ladino, the traditional language of Spanish Jews. In the 20th century, Flory's childhood is filled with the stories Nona tells about their ancestors and the music played and sung in Ladino by her talented family. Living in peace and harmony among Jews, Christians, and Muslims, their happy life is threatened as the perils of World War II approach. Fortunate to escape the death the rest of her family suffers, Flory eventually sails to the U.S. without the important key but with her own three significant symbols: her accordion, her Ladino, and her music. Levy gently weaves the history of the Sephardim into the story of Flory's specific Balkan Jewish life, also blending in some italicized Ladino phrases and words (unfortunately, rendering "grandfather" as "Nonu" rather than the traditional "Nono"). Lovely mixed-media illustrations limn several scenes across the centuries, adding perspective to an element of Sephardic culture that is mostly unknown today in American Jewish circles. Based on a true story, an inspirational reclamation of history."&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Levy&#x2019;s captivating picture book biography tells the story of Flory Jagoda, known today as the 'Keeper of the Flame' of Sephardic culture and music. The narrative begins centuries after Flory&#x2019;s descendants, the Altaras family, were expelled from Spain during the Inquisition due to their Sephardic identity. After centuries of living peacefully in Bosnia, Flory&#x2019;s family had to escape the dangers of World War II for the same reason. Forced to flee her home for America, Flory relied on music to stay connected to her family&#x2019;s heritage, even as war ravaged her home and stole away her loved ones. Levy&#x2019;s writing and Wimmer&#x2019;s mixed-media illustrations strike the perfect synergy, working together to celebrate music, heritage, and family histories. The writing is poetic and lyrical, effortlessly weaving centuries of history into the story while maintaining a strikingly intimate tone. Wimmer&#x2019;s illustrations are nuanced, and readers will enjoy discovering new details upon each rereading of the book. VERDICT A beautifully crafted story that touches on a lesser-known historical topic. Together, the words and pictures convey musicality without a single note of harmoniku, Flory&#x2019;s instrument of choice, having to be played. This work is a must-purchase for library collections."--<em>School Library Journal </em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Reputation Game: The Art of Changing How People See You</h2><p>It&#x2019;s a game you&#x2019;re already playing, whether you like it or not.

The mood was up, prosperity ruled and the standard of living was flying high. It was the land of plenty for a new generation who reinvented the way we lived. With colorful memorabilia and vintage photos, Southern California in the &#39;50s: Sun, Fun and Fantasy showcases this space-age promised land and the society that jump-started a cultural explosion. Charles Phoenix leads a nostalgic tour of his homeland, providing an up-close view of the way Southern Californians lived, where they worked and how they played. Readers will cruise in hot rods to Bob&#39;s Big Boy, go to the drive-in for Cokes and a movie, enjoy pools, patios and barbecues, and pull into that first McDonald&#39;s. Southern California in the &#39;50s covers the suburban spread of stylish tract homes, coffee shops, supermarkets, shopping centers and bowling alleys, the modern conveniences that replaced rural valley farms, dairy pastures and fragrant orange groves. Readers rub elbows with the elite in Hollywood, and enjoy novelty of themed restaurants, motels and roadside attractions, attend fairs, festivals and parades and tour Knott&#39;s Berry Farm, Santa&#39;s Village, Marineland, Pacific Ocean Park and Disneyland when all were brand new. Anyone who loves or lives the Southern California lifestyle must have Southern California in the &#39;50s.</p><p>Charles Phoenix grew up in Ontario in a 1950s ranch home during the 1960s and 1970s, and went on countless family outings to the beach, desert, mountains, shopping centers and amusement parks.

Each book contains a history of the opera, a synopsis of the story, a complete libretto in its original language as well as in English, dozens of photos, and a world-class Angel/EMI recording of the entire opera on two CDs. It&#39;s a must-have for die-hard opera lovers as well as those in need of an introduction to the timeless art form.</p><p>Mozart's last opera, the simultaneously comic and serious fairy tale <i>The Magic Flute</i> (<i>Die Zauberfloete</i>), is as problematic as anything in the medium. Some deplore it for its perceived sexism and racism; some deplore it for its arguably goofy plot. "Depending on your perspective," writes David Foil in his essay in this book, it "is either the silliest opera ever written or a work of profound insight that happens to be dressed in the trappings of a cartoon." That it is Mozart's sublime music that ennobles something meant to be merely a short-lived popular entertainment is not in question. <p> This volume, issued by Black Dog Opera Library, puts together Foil's essay, lots of pictures, a complete libretto (with running commentary) in English and German, and a classic recording on two compact discs in one comfortably priced hardcover package. It is a fine introduction to what remains a great opera, goofy plot or no. (And Bellini's plots aren't even goofier?) It is worth buying just for the now out-of-print EMI/Angel 1972 (remastered in 1987) recording, contained on two very long-playing CDs, found inside the front and back covers of the book. The dialogue portions work better in this version than in most recordings. Anneliese Rothenberger is an appealing Pamina, and Walter Berry is a delightful Papageno. Edda Moser nails the difficult music of the Queen of Night, while Kurt Moll is our day's definitive Sarastro. Wolfgang Sawallisch, brisk and never lugubrious, conducts his soloists and the Bavarian State Opera Chorus and Orchestra with total certainty.</p>The ultimate gift for opera lovers, the irresistible illustrated libretto pairs Davide Pizzigoni&#39;s engaging images with J. D. McClatchy&#39;s witty new translation and a music CD of the rare 1937 recording of Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.</p><h2>WAY-COOL SPANISH PHRASEBOOK 2/E: The Spanish that Kids Really Speaks!</h2><p><p><b>Be cool in Spanish!</b></p> <p>Perfect for kids eight- to fourteen-years old, <i>Way-Cool Spanish</i> covers the latest in kid language as it is spoken in the Spanish-speaking world.

How can we define modern humans, and how can we recognise our beginnings in the fossil and archaeological record? How can we accurately date fossils, including ones beyond the range of radiocarbon dating? What do the genetic data really tell us? Were our origins solely in Africa? Are modern humans a distinct species from ancient people such as the Neanderthals? And what contact did our ancestors have with them? How can we recognise modern humans behaviourally, and were traits such as complex language and art unique to modern humans? What forces shaped the origins of modern humans - were they climatic, dietary, social, or even volcanic? What drove the dispersals of modern humans from Africa, and how did our species spread over the globe? How did regional features evolve, and how significant are they? What exactly was the &#39;Hobbit&#39; of the island of Flores, and how was it related to us? Has human evolution stopped, or are we still evolving? What can we expect from future research on our origins? This book will make every reader think about what it means to be human.</p><p>Chris Stringer is Britain&#39;s foremost expert on human origins and works in the Department of Palaeontology at the Natural History Museum. He also currently directs the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain project, aimed at reconstructing the first detailed history of how and when Britain was occupied by early humans.

I&#x2019;ve never seen a grown man dote on a little boy as much as Abe dotes on mine. Even Blair doesn&#x2019;t pay that much attention, and Noah&#x2019;s his son. &#x201c;That beautiful wife of yours is a blessing. I wish you&#x2019;d have knocked her up and gotten married years ago.

I don&#x2019;t believe she has an issue with Dina, per se; she&#x2019;s more worried about other people taking issue with Dina and Abe together, and the problems that may arise. As progressive as Austin is, there&#x2019;s still plenty of hate to go around when it comes to the color of a person&#x2019;s skin.<br> <br>Abe shrugs. &#x201c;Slowly but surely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet that gorgeous little Gracie is helping.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s inevitable, the second anyone says his daughter&#x2019;s name, that Abe&#x2019;s face splits open with a wide grin.

For more, see www.thecollectedtraveler.com.&nbsp;<br>from the Introduction by Barrie Kerper<br><br>Tuscany is without doubt one of the most visited regions of Italy and is the region many people think of first whey they think of Italy.&nbsp; And with good reason:&nbsp; the treasures and pleasures of Florence alone could easily hold one&#x2019;s attention for years.&nbsp; Umbria, often known as &#x201c;the green heart of Italy,&#x201d; exists somewhat in Tuscany&#x2019;s shadow, but happily within the last dozen years or so many visitors have discovered that it, too, offers world-class gems of art and architecture, and its cuisine and landscapes are the equal to its neighbor&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Some people feel that Tuscany, Florence especially, is too clich�d and too popular for its own good, and too much like anywhere else.&nbsp; (Often, visitors complain excessively about the problems tourism creates, about Italian corruption and bureaucracy; but I like to remind them of a remark made many, many years ago by Lord Byron: &#x201c;There is, in fact, no law or government at all [in Italy]; and it is wonderful how well things go on without them.&#x201d;) But those who think Italy isn&#x2019;t exotic enough to be trave-worthy are simply mistaken: things <i>are</i> different in Tuscany and Umbria.&nbsp; Such everyday scenes as a young woman crossing a cobblestone street in stiletto heels balancing two cups of espresso, men conversing animatedly using so many unfamiliar hand and facial gestures you&#x2019;d think you had landed on Mars, widowed women dressed head to toe in black, or merchants closing up shop simultaneously for <i>la pausa</i> (the lunchtime siesta) on a hot summer afternoon are just as foreign to a North American as what you might experience in Asia or Africa.&nbsp;<br><br>Florence, like other cities throughout Tuscany and Umbria, is filled with much that is old but also plenty that is new. Unfortunately, some American fast food chains have found a foothold here and many international stores are the very same ones we find in North America; still, it is mostly the older sites we come to see. I for one will never forget the day I first saw Santa Maria del Fiori, Florence&#x2019;s Duomo: as I walked down a narrow street the name of which I no longer remember, I saw a sliver of it suddenly; as I approached it and discerned the different colors and patterns of marble, I was filled with a warmth and a happiness to be alive I&#x2019;ve rarely felt again.&nbsp; Over the years, no matter how crowded Florence becomes, the Duomo will never fail to impress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Part of the reason Florence can feel completely overrun with tourists is that it&#x2019;s quite a compact city and you can run repeatedly into the same visitors.&nbsp; But it is also the remarkable repository of a huge number of the world&#x2019;s greatest works of art.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s easy to succumb to Stendhal Syndrome, named for the French novelist Stendhal, who felt physically sick after he visited Santa Croce.&nbsp; It refers to the feeling of being completely overwhelmed by your surroundings. (My translation: seeing and doing way too much.)&nbsp; Visitors to Florence who arrive with too long a list of must-sees are prime candidates for the syndrome. Author and Italian expert Fred Plotkin counseled against falling into this trap in his foreword to Claudio Gatti&#x2019;s <i>Florence in Detail</i> (an excellent guidebook), by advising, &#x201c;Like it or not, one must adopt a policy of &#x2018;<i>Poco,</i> <i>ma buono'</i> (loosely translated as &#x2018;Do less, but do it really well&#x2019;) to experience what Florence has to offer.&nbsp; A mad dash through a gallery will leave you with only fleeting impressions.&nbsp; Spend ten minutes in front of one painting and you will see remarkable things that a two-minute look could not reveal; spend an hour in front of that same painting and your life will be changed.&nbsp; To really pause and reflect, whether in front of a sculpture or a dish of gelato, is to find the presence of art and genius in all things.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I would add that by creating more reasonable itineraries, you actually give yourself the opportunity to acquire more than a superficial understanding of a place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I particularly enjoy simply sitting at a caf� table, looking, listening, and wondering.&nbsp; What is life like in the beautiful apartment building off the piazza, the one the young boy has just entered carrying a purchase from the <i>panificio</i>?&nbsp; I am curious about the elderly man in his shoe repair shop, and the fruit vendor at the Mercato Centrale who talks nonstop and greets everyone as though she&#x2019;s know them all her life.&nbsp; And, enviously, I wonder where the two office girls breaking for a cigarette bought their beautiful suits. &#x201c;Slow&#x201d; is a good word to keep in mind when visiting Italy.</p><h2>The Culinary Herbal: Growing and Preserving 97 Flavorful Herbs</h2><p><b>&#x201c;This fresh new masterpiece excites the senses!&#x201d; &#x2014;Rosemary Gladstar, herbalist and bestselling&nbsp;author</b><br><br> Good cooks know that when it comes to herbs, there is nothing better than harvesting them fresh from the garden.&nbsp;<i>The Culinary Herbal&nbsp;</i>highlights 97 delicious varieties&#x2014;like black cumin, fenugreek, lemon balm, and sassafras&#x2014;that every food lover will want to add to their kitchen garden.

Russell provides an expansive, accessible account of Canadian history from the pre-Confederation period to the present day. By focusing on what he calls the "three pillars" of English Canada, French Canada, and Aboriginal Canada, Russell advances an important view of our country as one founded on and informed by "incomplete conquests".

Herein, John Cage recalls the turning point in his career; Ben Johnston criticizes the operas of his teacher Harry Partch; La Monte Young attributes his creative discipline to a Morman childhood; and much more. The results are revelatory conversations with some of America's most radical musical innovators.</p><p><b>William Duckworth</b> is a composer, professor of music at Bucknell University, author of two books on music theory, and editor of <i>John Cage at 75.</i> He lives in New Jersey.Duckworth, a music professor at Bucknell, is a composer himself, which helps when talking to avant-garde composers about their works. His book consists of lengthy, original interviews with 17 of them, beginning with the granddaddy of them all, John Cage, who died three years ago at 80, and concluding with John Zorn, who is barely into his 40s. The profiles are sympathetic, informed and lucid, teasing a remarkable quantity of information, even emotion, out of people whose music, to a majority of listeners, must seem remote or perverse. Most of the composers?experimentalists, minimalists, performance artists?describe years of experimentation, often in conditions of adversity and poverty, before having achieved their signature forms and styles. They have a great deal in common: few of them are remotely interested in the Western classical music tradition (John Cage acknowledges here, "I don't have an ear for music and I never have; I can't remember a melody"); many are more interested in rhythm and timbre than in harmony, melody or counterpoint; and Indian, Asian and African musical styles are common sources of inspiration. Some?Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass?now have a measure of fame and success, while others, such as Conlon Nancarrow and Pauline Oliveros, remain essentially fringe figures, though with devoted followings. Duckworth's enthusiasm and understanding help to make them all more comprehensible.

Yet the process of finding an authentic spiritual teacher who resonates with you can be daunting, especially for anyone who has had a negative experience with a guide. Exploring the emotional nuances of mentoring relationships, Greg Bogart details the path of spiritual apprenticeship: the process of aligning with a teacher, establishing a dynamic spiritual practice, and the later stages of separation and finding the teacher within. <br> <br>The author explores the importance of gauging your inner response and feeling of trust and resonance with a teacher and your readiness to receive initiation. He explains how the teacher-student relationship affects the student&#x2019;s state of consciousness over time and how most students eventually need to become independent from their spiritual guides. Describing emotional conflicts that can arise at this stage, he shows how wise teachers accept our need to separate and graduate while immature teachers try to thwart and control us. <br> <br>Openly sharing his own personal journey, the author illustrates the lasting resonance of his encounters with several provocative spiritual mentors, including Swami Muktananda and Dane Rudhyar. He discusses how some fierce teachers practice "crazy wisdom" to confront our doubts, fears, and fixations and to activate our dormant potentials. Examining practices in Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist Yoga, Sufism, and Jewish and Christian mysticism, he also explores the deeper mystical aspects of the guru-student relationship. <br> <br>The author shows how, ultimately, initiation leads the spiritual seeker to find the teacher within and how this can naturally lead to teaching others. Describing nine stages of the spiritual seeker&#x2019;s journey, the author affirms that a direct path to self-liberation is still attainable through initiation and instruction in the company of sages.</p><p>Greg Bogart, Ph.D., MFT, is a psychotherapist in private practice in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is a lecturer in psychology at Sonoma State University, a teacher at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and the author of numerous books on astrology, dreams, yoga, and spiritual depth psychology.<b>Stage One<br>Choosing a Teacher</b><br><i>Finding the Lineage and Qualities that Speak to Your Path</i><br><br>Meeting a teacher can impact us so powerfully that we&#x2019;re seized by a desire to change our lives and embrace the quest for mystical realization. When Rumi, a highly respected scholar, met his teacher Shams of Tabriz, Shams took a book Rumi was writing about philosophy and threw it into a well. Rumi became an ecstatic devotee of Shams and abandoned all else, including scholarship and family responsibilities. After finding a teacher a person may begin to undergo a noticeable transformation and change of habits and lifestyle. One may experience deeper meditations or feel a blissful energy or an opening of the heart, the kindling of an inner fire. Rumi said:<br><br>What draws Friends together<br>does not conform to Laws of Nature.<br>Form doesn&#x2019;t know about spiritual closeness. . . .<br>A hand shifts our birdcages around.<br>Some are brought closer. Some move apart.<br>Do not try to reason it out. Be conscious<br>of who draws you and who not.<br><br>A common experience after meeting a teacher is for everything in our lives to fall apart. In the Koran it is said, &#x201c;I am with those whose hearts are broken for My sake.&#x201d; Old interests fall away, and old friendships become less compelling as a seeker turns toward the path of spiritual awakening. The disciples of the Indian guru Ramakrishna underwent a profound transformation as a result of their contact with their saintly master. Many were filled with a feverish devotion and burning for enlightenment. Many of them renounced worldly life soon after Ramakrishna&#x2019;s death and became monks committed to pursuing Self-realization.<br><br>We accept a teacher who inspires us to attain the enlightened state through meditation, yoga, and other consciousness-enhancing practices. In deep meditation, the mind quiets down and awareness turns inward, becoming self-reflective, becoming aware of itself as <i>awareness</i>. The diligent practitioner experiences the growth of tranquility, contentment, and wisdom. In Buddhist terms, meditation reveals our <i>dharmakaya</i> nature--the truth body, the pure mind, like a clear mirror. In the Hindu tradition this is known as realization of the Self or Atman, which is one with Brahman, the Absolute.<br><br>We need a teacher not only to teach us techniques and doctrine but also to embody the enlightened state, so that we can recognize it in ourselves and attain it. We may also choose a teacher to learn a particular method such as meditation, yoga, or shamanic journeying. Even in cases where a teacher isn&#x2019;t a fully enlightened Buddha, sage, or siddha guru, we could still grow by studying with that person for a period of time--if the teacher seems clear and balanced and we feel confident that this person can guide us effectively through a stage of our transformation. It&#x2019;s enough that the teacher embodies a quality of freedom that we wish to emulate.<br><br>Teachers appear in many guises. When I met my hatha yoga teacher, Allan Bateman, in 1979, I found that he was quite an unusual individual. Self-taught in yoga, Allan looked like a muscle-bound jock. He moved around his studio in a bikini, sang opera arias, and held in the palm of his hand an enormous cat named Godzilla, who lay on his back stretching out his paws in a magnificent backbend, in full spinal extension. Allan bragged modestly about this and that, and talked about his cattle ranch upstate where he had a herd of Beefalo. I learned so much yoga from this man, I didn&#x2019;t care if he was some great pundit or intellectual. He wasn&#x2019;t trying to be saintly. He used his body in his teaching. He was very graceful and respectful and supportive of intelligent movement. He was a free and sexy guy, very confident, and a positive male role model.<br><br>John Welwood, author of <i>Awakening the Heart</i>, notes, &#x201c;Since genuine spiritual teachers come in many different shapes and forms, we&#x2019;ll no doubt fail if we try to spell out how a good guru should behave.&#x201d; David Frawley, founder and director of the American Institute of Vedic Studies, echoes this view, saying, &#x201c;Great gurus may be saints with impeccable characters and lifestyles. However, they may also look like madmen and refuse to conform to any social norms. Society may consider them scoundrels.&#x201d; We shouldn&#x2019;t accept a teacher just because everybody else says this is an enlightened sage; nor should we immediately reject all teachers who don&#x2019;t conform to our expectations or conceptions of holiness. The teacher doesn&#x2019;t have to be famous, or an impoverished ascetic, or surrounded by important disciples. What&#x2019;s important is that the teacher&#x2019;s personal example inspires us, the teacher&#x2019;s words speak to us deeply, and the teacher&#x2019;s presence affects us intensely. The guide shows us glimpses of the goal of the spiritual journey, as well as a path we can follow to reach this goal.<br><br>In this book we&#x2019;ll consider how spiritual teachers have been described in a number of world religions. From the insights derived from these traditions, we&#x2019;ll reach a number of conclusions:<br><br>1. Spiritual apprenticeship begins with a personal relationship with a teacher who tangibly affects our awareness and inspires us to practice a contemplative discipline in order to attain enlightenment.<br><br>2. Initiation connects the student to the influence of a spiritual lineage that transcends the individual teacher.<br><br>3. The student-teacher relationship involves the mutual meditation of the student and teacher upon one another, and may entail the deliberate cultivation of a form of psychic merger or unity that can have a transformative effect upon the student.<br><br>4. The relationship may involve experiences of grace in which the teacher functions as a conduit for transmission of transpersonal forces.<br><br>When choosing a guide, proceed with care. It&#x2019;s important to take sufficient time to examine the teacher&#x2019;s character and note any internal changes that occur as a result of contact with this being. A powerful inner shift of consciousness after meeting a teacher signals us to seek further contact and instruction.</p><h2>126 Bordeaux &amp; Surrounding Areas Zoom</h2><p>(Edition updated in 2019) The MICHELIN zoom map Bordeaux &amp; surrounding areas is the ideal travel companion to fully explore this French tourist destination thanks to its easy-to-use format and its scale of 1/150,000.

Kernberg explores the role of aggression in severe personality disorders and in normal and perverse sexuality, integrating new developments in psychoanalytic theory with findings from clinical work with severely regressed patients. The book also integrates Dr Kernberg&#39;s studies of the descriptive, structural, and psychodynamic features of problems stemming from pathological aggression with the vicissitudes of their psychoanalytic treatment. Finally, Dr Kernberg demonstrates the importance of differential diagnosis for effective psychoanalytically inspired treatment of these disorders, providing a variety of clincial illustrations. The book begins by relating the dual-drive theory of libido and aggression to contemporary developments in affect theory. Dr Kernberg then applies this general theory of affects to aggression, which in its pathological form centres on the affect of hatred. He analyzes sado-masochhistic, hysterical-hysteroid and narcissistic-antisocial spectrums of personality disorders, emphasizing how aggression is structured in each group. Dr Kernberg then describes and updates the theoretical frame underlying his approach to the tretment of these disorders, outlines their clinical manifestations, and illustrates their diagnosis and treatment, ranging from standard psychoanalysis with infantile personalities, to psychoanalytic psychotherpy with borderline personalities, to the psychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of psychosis and hospital milieu treatment in the management of highly regressed patients. In the final section, Dr Kernberg links the findings from psychoanalytic approaches to personality disorders with those from the psychoanalytic study of sexual perversions.</p><p></p><h2>Resuscitation of a Hanged Man</h2><p><p>Leonard English, a sad and intense young man recovering from a suicide attempt, moves to the Cape Cod resort of Provincetown to work as a disk jockey cum private detective. On his first day there, he encounters a beautiful young woman and falls desperately in love with her -- only to find out she prefers those of her own sex to men. English's first assignment, a search for an elusive artist, proves equally frustrating. As winter lengthens and Leonard's anguish mounts, his desperate quests -- for the artist, for love, for redemption -- take on an increasingly apocalyptic coloring.</p></p><p>Denis Johnson is the author of <em>The Name of the World, Already Dead, Jesus' Son, Resuscitation of a Hanged Man, Fiskadoro, The Stars at Noon,</em> and <em>Angels.</em> His poetry has been collected in the volume <em>The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly.</em> He is the recipient of a Lannan Fellowship and a Whiting Writer's Award, among many other honors for his work. He lives in northern Idaho.Resuscitation of a Hanged Man<br>1980He came there in the off-season. So much was off. All bets were off. The last deal was off. His timing was off, or he wouldn't have come here at this moment, and also every second arc lamp along the peninsular highway was switched off. He'd been through several states along the turnpikes, through weary tollgates and stained mechanical restaurants, and by now he felt as if he'd crossed a hostile foreign land to reach this fog with nobody in it, only yellow lights blinking and yellow signs wandering past the car's windows silently. There was a single fair-sized town on the peninsula, a place with more than one shopping center in it and boarded-up seafood stands strung along the roadside, and the traveller, whose name was Leonard English, thought he'd stop there for a drink, just one drink, before going on. But he was drawn into a very interesting conversation with a man whose face got to look more and more like a dead pig's face in the dim red light. What they were talking about really wasn't all that memorable--it was more the man's face--but the drinks got slippery and English's money was all wet by the time he got out of there, and as he made a U-turnthrough an intersection the world seemed to buckle beneath him and the car's hood flew up before the window. English held the wheel and jammed the brake, waiting for the rest of this earthquake, or this bombing or God's wrath, to destroy the town. A shriek, like the tearing of metal train wheels along metal rails, died away. Somebody was opening the door for him ... but he was opening the door for himself, and now he was getting out of the car. There wasn't any cataclysm. It was just a town at night, quiet and useless, with buildings that looked like big toys or false fronts lit by arc lamps and backed by a tremendous bleakness. Somehow his Volkswagen had climbed up onto a traffic island. The whole thing would have been embarrassing, but he couldn't seem to form any clear picture of what had happened. Blood ran down his forehead and blinded half his sight. The air reeked: the tank was ripped and twenty dollars' worth of gasoline covered the asphalt. In his imagination it burst into flames. A cabdriver stopped and came to stand beside him and said, "You made a wrong turn." English did not dispute this.&nbsp;<br>To reach his destination at the end of the Cape, English engaged the cabdriver's services, services he couldn't afford any more than he was going to be able to afford this accident."He gonna chadge you exry," the cabdriver said.Chadge? English guessed the driver was talking about the old man who'd towed his car away, but what was he trying to say? "Right," English said."You from Bwostin?" the cabbie asked him.This was just what the policeman had asked him amid the wreckage, saying <i>Boston</i> like <i>Bwostin.</i> "Mr. Leonard English," the officer had said. Looking right at English's Midwestern driver's license, he had inquired after his origins: "You from Bwostin?" "I just got here from Lawrence, Kansas," English told theofficer. <i>"Kansas?"</i> the officer said. "Lawrence, Kansas?"--and English said yes. A little later the officer said, "You're drunk. But I'm gonna let you off.""Drunk? I'm not drunk," English said."Yes you are, you most definitely are," the officer said, "or you wou'nt be arguing with me." With a certain vague tenderness, he was applying a Band-Aid to English's forehead.English said, "I'm a little tipsy. I don't understand what you're saying.""That's better," the officer said.English was glad when the policeman left him in the cabdriver's custody, because he felt cut off from the world here, and to be scrutinized by a powerful figure in a place he hadn't even seen in the daylight yet left him shaken. Properly speaking, this wasn't even a peninsula. He'd had to cross a large bridge to get here. It was an island. A place apart.And now, as they rattled toward this phony peninsula's other end, English was sitting up front with the cabdriver. English was dizzy, and on top of that there seemed to be an exhaust leak, but the driver kept saying, "You're A-OK now, brother." "No, I'm not," English said. They weren't in a taxicab. It was almost six in the morning and the driver was going in his station wagon to his home a couple of towns down the road, taking English dozens of miles out of his way for twenty dollars. "I like to drive," the cabbie said. He puffed on a joint wrapped in yellow paper.English turned it down. "Grass makes me feel kind of paranoid.""I don't get paranoid," the driver said. But he was a paranoid personality if English had ever seen one. "This beyond here, this is absolutely black," the driver said, pointing with the glowing end of his reefer ahead, to where the four-lane highway turned two-way. "No more lights, no more houses"--he drew a chestfulof smoke--"nuthin, nuthin, nuthin. We won't see no traffic. Not car one." Immediately the red taillights of another car shone ahead. "I think I know this guy." He stomped the gas. "I think this is Danny Moss"--pronounced Dyany Mwas--"is that a Toyota? Cheez, looka how fast this guy's running." They were doing eighty. "<i>We're</i> gonna catch you, Danny. <i>We're</i> gaining on this sucker." But they were falling behind. "Ain't that a Toyota?" he said. The red taillights ahead went right, and the cabdriver's gaze followed their course as he and his passenger sailed past the turn they'd taken. "Yeah, that's a Toyota! Yeah, that's him! Yeah, that's Danny Moss!"Actually, they hadn't come to any place of absolute blackness. In a little while the sun was up, burning without heat above the road, and before they reached Provincetown they sped through three or four more little villages, in one of which they stopped and had breakfast. It turned out that Phil, the driver, subscribed to the branch of historical thought characterized by a belief in extraterrestrial interference, previous highly advanced civilizations, and future global cataclysms, both human-made and geological. English now learned something about these things. "All the elemental phosphorus is gonna be like zero, completely gone. We'll be strangling each other in the streets for a little phosphorus," Phil said, "elemental phosphorus. The roads are gonna run with blood. Nobody even knows about it. Nobody's even surprised. Five thousand years ago on the earth they had a big cataclysm and a huge, what is it, whatyoucallit, <i>megadeath.</i> Partly because of running out of some of these elements you need in your body, like phosphorus." He got into a philosophical talk with their waitress and told her, "I think our world could really be some form of Hell, you know what I'm saying?" The waitress saw his point. "There's so much suffering here on earth," she said. Phil knew all the waitresses, and it was after nine when they got back on the road.English fell asleep. When he woke up, the route had gone strange. White dunes made walls on either side of them. European music came out of the radio. They drove through a drift of sand.In a few minutes his head was clear again, and he was looking at the sandy outskirts of the last town in America. The sun was shining above it now. A tower made of stone rose up in the distance. The seaside curved north, to their left, and the wooden buildings were laid out solid, bright and still as a painting, against the beach.They followed the road into town and lost sight of the harbor as they came down the main street of shops. Now there were pedestrians moving alongside them in the chilly sunshine. The traffic crawled. "This crowd is nothing compared to summer," Phil told him. Half the shops appeared closed, and English had a sense of people walking around here where they didn't belong, in an area that might have been abandoned after a panic. Three ungainly women--were they men, in bright skirts?--danced a parody of a chorus line by a tavern's door, arms around one another's shoulders. Passing along the walks and ambling down the middle of the street were people in Bermuda shorts and children eating ice-cream cones as if it weren't under 60 Fahrenheit today. On the lawn of the town hall, surrounded by grey pigeons and scattering crusts of bread out of a white paper bag, stood a woman who was very clearly not a woman but a man: as if a woman wore football shoulder pads and other bulky protection beneath her very modestly tailored dress. Another man in a dress was mailing a letter at the blue mailbox just six feet away. And a cross-dresser on roller skates loomed above two others sitting on a bench, patting his brittle wig lightly with one hand, the other hand on his hip, while laughter that couldn't be heard passed among them. A very tall woman, who might have been a man, talked with a bunch of grade-school childrenout in front of a bakery. English cleared his throat. He had a chance to look at everyone until he was sick of their faces, because the car wasn't getting anywhere.Phil smacked the horn, but nothing happened. "Horn don't work. This is making me apeshit. I'm gonna run some bastards over."They found the source of the traffic jam four blocks down, where a huge-bottomed transvestite comedian on the balcony of a cabaret-and-hotel delivered his Mae West impersonation for free. "Move over, honey!" he shouted down to a woman in a halted convertible. The woman ducked her head in embarrassment and put her hand on the arm of the man driving. Around them the shoppers and tourists, variously shocked and mesmerized, or curious and entertained, laughed at the comedian with his cascading platinum wig and his stupendous, unexplainable breasts. Later that night English would see someone being carried on a stretcher out of the side doors of this building and through the wet, falling snow to an ambulance. And he would think of this man on the balcony in his evening gown making jokes about his potbelly, gripping it with a hand that glittered with rings while flapping his huge false eyelashes, and English wouldn't feel equipped, he wouldn't feel grown-up enough, to be told the whole story about this town.&nbsp;<br>Phil knew any number of people in Provincetown. He was connected all up and down the Cape. Long before the Pilgrims, English gathered, long before the Indians, way back past the time of cataclysms, even before the golden age of the extraterrestrial star-wanderers who had mated with monkeys to produce us all, members of Phil's family had arrived here and opened small dark restaurants with steamy walls and radios chattering and yowling in the kitchen, and had applied for liquor licenses which to this day they were denied because the grudges againstthem, though small ones, were eternal. What all this meant was that English wouldn't have to go to a motel. Phil had a cousin who ran a rooming house, freshly painted white and spilling winter roses over a knee-high picket fence, where English could stay cheaply.Phil insisted on carrying English's suitcase up the long stairs through an atmosphere of mingled disinfectant and air-freshening spray into a room that was small but not cheerless. There were big orange ladybugs printed on the white curtains. A faintly discolored portrait of John F. Kennedy hung on the wall above the desk. The bathroom looked harmless--blue sink, blue toilet, blue tub scoured nearly white. "All right, hey, not bad," English assured Phil, but it had every quality of the end of the line.Now that they'd travelled together and English was one of the family, with his very own room in Phil's illustrious cousin's house, Phil wouldn't accept a fare. English had to follow him down the stairs and out to his half-disintegrated yellow station wagon, insisting. Then he accepted the twenty-dollar bill that English pressed on him, and gripped the new tenant's hand with his, the money caught between their palms. His eyes were moist. They were two of the same sort, men past thirty without a lot to recommend them; but this happened to English every day. He had a feeling they'd stay strangers.After Phil was gone, English lay on the bed awhile, but he couldn't sleep because it was daytime and also a little too quiet. He wondered if everybody was at work. Then he remembered that it was Sunday. They'd passed a church, he and Phil, as they'd inched in Phil's vehicle down to the end of Commercial Street, the street of shops, and then in the other direction down Bradford, now his street, the street of his home. English hadn't really noticed, but he thought it might have been a Catholic church. He thought he would go to Mass.In his first few hours on this dismal Cape, before he'd even seen the daylight here, he'd managed to smash his car and put himself in debt to a strange and probably larcenous auto body shop. The idea of a fresh start took on value and weight as he splashed water on his face and, lacking any kind of towel, dried it with the corner of his bedspread, uncovering in the process a bare mattress. If Mass hadn't started at ten, it would be starting soon, at eleven.&nbsp;<br>It took English only a few minutes to walk there--St. Peter's, a Catholic institution. He hadn't missed the service. Under a sky the color of iron, people were lugging themselves like laundry toward the big doors of the church. A black arrow outlined in silver directed English toward a side door if he wanted to confess his sins.In a small room next door to the administrative offices, he found a priest bidding goodbye to an old woman and cleaning his spectacles on the hem of his cassock. English backed away as she passed out of the place, and now it was his turn to sit in the wooden chair, separated from his confessor by a partition with little metal wheels.This moment seemed to have swooped down on him from nowhere. He'd tried several times recently to make a good confession, but he'd failed. The problem was that about a year ago he'd more or less attempted to take his own life, to kill himself, and couldn't get started telling why.The priest, a small, preoccupied man, made the sign of the cross and awaited the rote utterances, praying to himself in a rapid whisper.But English had only one thing to confess. "I'm new in town--excuse me ..." Violently he cleared his throat. Now he noticed the room was full of flowers.The priest stopped praying. "Yes. Well, young friend. New in town.""I wonder if--Father, can we dispense with the ... ?" English waved his hand around, and was embarrassed to find that this gesture included the confessional and the cross. He'd meant only the formalities, the ritual. What he wanted was plain absolution."It's a nice quiet time of year to come," Father said in a puzzled tone.English waited a minute. The flowers smelled terrible. "I just went crazy," he said. "I committed--I killed myself.""Uh, you ..." The priest looked up through the partition's screen as if only now beginning to see he wasn't by himself. "In what sense," he began, and didn't finish."What I mean is," English said, "not <i>killed. Tried,</i> I mean. I tried to hang myself.""I see," Father said, meaning, perhaps, that he didn't see.After a few seconds Father said, "Well then. You say you've tried to ... Is there something you've done about this? Have you sought help?""I am. I'm--I'm confessing.""But ..." The priest stalled again.English wondered how much time before Mass. Nobody else was behind him. "I mean ..." he said."Okay," the priest said. "Go on.""The thing is, I'm starting o...</p><h2>The Book of Incense: Enjoying the Traditional Art of Japanese Scents</h2><p>Incense has a long history in Japan.

Shana was the little one, about two and a half, and she was cute. I thought maybe she&#x2019;d be all right. She had soft blonde hair and big blue eyes, and she said my name, plain as anything, right after me when her mother asked me what it was. &#x201c;Darcy Ann Stevens,&#x201d; Shana echoed, and leaned against my leg.<br> <br>&#x201c;And do they call you Darcy Ann, or just Darcy?&#x201d; Mrs. Foster asked, smiling. Only she wasn&#x2019;t just Mrs., she was a psychiatrist, and my friend Irene said everybody called her doctor. I wasn&#x2019;t sure how I was supposed to address her, so I hadn&#x2019;t called her anything at all.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just Darcy,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I looked at the middle one, whose name was Melissa. She was four, and she was cute, too; her brown hair curled, but she stuck out her lower lip and looked at me with those big dark eyes and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you for a sitter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs./Dr. Foster smiled again. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be rude, dear. Of course you&#x2019;re going to like Darcy as a sitter. And this, Darcy, is Jeremy. He&#x2019;s six.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jeremy, too, had dark hair and the same dark eyes. When his mother looked away from him, he stuck his tongue out at me. He didn&#x2019;t say anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;ve had quite a bit of experience baby-sitting, Darcy,&#x201d; Mrs./Dr. Foster said. She turned directly toward me on the big oatmeal-colored couch, and Jeremy, behind her back, stuck his thumbs in his ears and wiggled his fingers at me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re how old? Fourteen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, nearly,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirteen and a half.&#x201d; I was only stretching it by three months. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ve been babysitting since I was eleven.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Eleven,&#x201d; she echoed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very young to start. You must be quite mature for your age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;Everybody says so. It probably comes from having two little brothers. I helped take care of them, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now Jeremy had a finger in each corner of his mouth, stretching it to make a grotesque face. Melissa looked at him and copied his actions. I was already having second thoughts about this.<br> <br>In the first place, I&#x2019;d never taken on three kids before. And none of the children I&#x2019;d baby-sat had ever lived in a place like this, either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Mrs./Dr. Foster said. &#x201c;Your references are certainly good ones.&#x201d; She handed the letters back to me, and I rested them on my knees. &#x201c;Shall we see you tomorrow afternoon, then, Darcy? Say at one o&#x2019;clock? I can&#x2019;t tell you how happy we are to have found someone reliable to see to the children while Mrs. Murphy is having her root canals done. I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re going to love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jeremy had his tongue out again, wiggling it like a serpent&#x2019;s tongue; I wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised if there had been a little steam with it, or a blast of fire. Melissa watched him to see what he did and imitated it a moment later.<br> <br>Mrs./Dr. Foster stood up, so I did, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t discuss pay, did we?&#x201d; Mrs./Dr. Foster said, hesitating as we reached the front door. She named an hourly rate that was twice what anybody else paid me, and I swallowed the words I&#x2019;d almost been ready to say. Maybe you&#x2019;d better find someone older, more experienced with three kids. &#x201c;Will that be satisfactory?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Of course, we always pay a bonus for a job well done.&#x201d;<br> <br>A bonus. On top of twice my normal hourly rates. I ignored Jeremy&#x2019;s wicked little face and forced myself to smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be here tomorrow at one,&#x201d; I agreed.<br> <br>My brother Tim was waiting for me at the curb in his beat-up old Volkswagen. He leaned across and opened the door for me&#x2014;because it sticks, not because he was polite&#x2014;and I slid in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, get the job?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. I start tomorrow afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br>He put the car in gear and turned the key, but didn&#x2019;t drive away. He was looking at the Foster house. &#x201c;Pretty ritzy place. What&#x2019;s it like inside?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fancy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a swimming pool out back. I saw it through the patio doors.&#x201d;<br> <br>He lifted his eyebrows. Tim looks like the rest of us in the Stevens family. We all, except Mom, have red hair and freckles. Her hair is auburn, and I keep hoping mine will get darker when I get older, so it will look like hers. &#x201c;They going to let you swim in it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess while I&#x2019;m baby-sitting I can swim if I want to,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nobody mentioned it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you like the kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>I made a face. &#x201c;Little brats, I think. Still it&#x2019;s only for a couple of hours a day on the afternoons when the housekeeper, Mrs. Murphy, goes to the dentist for root canal work. I should be able to stand it for a few hours a day. And she said there&#x2019;d be a bonus if I did a good job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds good. Maybe you&#x2019;ll make enough to get your own stereo on this one job instead of taking all summer,&#x201d; Tim said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope so. I think I&#x2019;m going to earn it.&#x201d; I told him about the two older ones making faces at me, and how Melissa had said she didn&#x2019;t want me for a sitter.<br> <br>Tim laughed and eased the car away from the curb. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t bring you over every day and pick you up. You&#x2019;ll have to ride your bike.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. I swiveled around in the seat to look back at the big Spanish-style house I&#x2019;d just come out of. We don&#x2019;t live in the part of the country where Spanish-style houses are plentiful; it really stood out in this neighborhood of huge, expensive houses.<br> <br>And because I turned to look, I saw the car that pulled out behind us. It was black, almost as beat-up as Tim&#x2019;s Volkswagen, not the kind of car you&#x2019;d expect in this part of town. The sun reflected off the windshield, so I couldn&#x2019;t see who was driving, or how many people were in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re being followed,&#x201d; I joked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because we look like we&#x2019;re rich,&#x201d; Tim said, glancing in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;I mean, that&#x2019;s who they&#x2019;d follow to rob, right? Somebody with a classy car.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said, and settled back for the ride home. The funny thing was, when we turned off onto our own street, that black car was still behind us. I saw it when we went around the corner.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tim,&#x201d; I began, but he wasn&#x2019;t listening. He was looking toward our house, a big old-fashioned place with a veranda across the front of it, where three teenaged boys were sitting on the steps drinking pop out of cans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, the gang&#x2019;s here. We&#x2019;re supposed to be going out to the river to swim. It&#x2019;s lucky your interview didn&#x2019;t take any longer, because if I&#x2019;d missed going, I&#x2019;d have disowned you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since he disowned me about twice a day, that wasn&#x2019;t too upsetting. I did wonder about the car, though. When we bumped into the driveway, I craned my neck to see where the other car went.<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t stop, but kept on right past our house. There were two men in it; I couldn&#x2019;t make out any more than that.<br> <br>I had to wait for Tim to open the door before I could get out. The guys on the steps waved and yelled, and Tim got out and trotted toward them.<br> <br>I stood for a minute, looking after the mysterious black car. It traveled slowly along to the next corner and turned as if to go back toward State Street, which is the main street in Marysville, the one we&#x2019;d just turned off.<br> <br>Just somebody driving around, maybe lost, I decided. After all, why would anybody follow us?<br> <br>I went past the boys and into the house. Inside I made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and forgot about the car. It didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with me.

The tumultuous period witnessed the contruction of many of the architectural monuments that have come to define New York: the Chrysler Building, the Empire State, Rockefeller Center, and the George Washington Bridge. While focusing on these landmark structures, the authors consider other components of the built environment as well: the public housing projects, highways, parks, and commercial, residential, and entertainment districts. Their delight in their subject is evidenced by the lively text and careful selection of over 600 period photographs and illustrations. Highly recommended.H.

The biographer embarks on a series of interviews with people who were important to Coetzee during the period when he was "finding his feet as a writer"-in his thirties and sharing a run-down cottage in the suburbs of Cape Town with his widowed father. Their testimonies create an image of an awkward, reserved, and bookish young man who finds it difficult to connect with the people around him. An innovative and inspired work of fiction-incisive, elegant, and often surprisingly funny- <i>Summertime</i> allows one of the most revered writers of our time to imagine his own life with a critical and unsparing eye.</p><p><p>A young English biographer is researching a book about the late South African writer John Coetzee, focusing on Coetzee in his thirties, at a time when he was living in a rundown cottage in the Cape Town suburbs with his widowed father -- a time, the biographer is convinced, when Coetzee was finding himself as a writer.</p><p>Never having met the man, the biographer interviews five people who knew Coetzee well, including a married woman with whom he had an affair, his cousin Margot, and a Brazilian dancer whose daughter took English lessons with him. These accounts add up to an image of an awkward, reserved, and bookish young man who finds it hard to make meaningful connections with people.</p>Born in Cape Town, South Africa, on February 9, 1940, John Michael Coetzee studied first at Cape Town and later at the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a Ph.D. degree in literature. In 1972 he returned to South Africa and joined the faculty of the University of Cape Town. His works of fiction include <b>Dusklands, Waiting for the Barbarians</b>, which won South Africa&#x2019;s highest literary honor, the Central News Agency Literary Award, and the <b>Life and Times of Michael K</b>., for which Coetzee was awarded his first Booker Prize in 1983. He has also published a memoir, <b>Boyhood: Scenes From a Provincial Life</b>, and several essays collections. He has won many other literary prizes including the Lannan Award for Fiction, the Jerusalem Prize and The <b>Irish Times</b> International Fiction Prize. In 1999 he again won Britain&#x2019;s prestigious Booker Prize for <b>Disgrace</b>, becoming the first author to win the award twice in its 31-year history. In 2003, Coetzee was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><h2>The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections, 1788-1790, Volume III</h2><p><p><i>The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections</i>, in four volumes, will bring together the relevant documents concerning these elections&#x2014;source materials essential for all historians and researchers of eighteenth-century American history. This third volume covers the elections in New Jersey and New York.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contemporaries understood that the first federal Congress would &#x201c;flesh out&#x201d; the Constitution, and that the first federal elections were therefore an important step in the continuing struggle to shape, influence, and control the central government. The elections also provided the states with an unusual opportunity to experiment with electoral forms. The Constitution and the Confederation Congress allowed the states wide latitude in choosing Senators and in framing their laws for the election of the first presidential Electors and Representatives. This latitude encouraged experimentation and a lively public discussion about the entire electoral process.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The documents presented have been collected from a wide range of sources: state legislative journals, records of debates, compilations of state laws, executive and judicial records, and other official sources, as well as from unofficial sources such as personal letters, diaries, newspapers, pamphlets, and broadsides. The subjects include preelection public and private speculation about all aspects of the elections, the official and unofficial actions of each of the states in establishing the mechanics of the elections for presidential Electors, Representatives, and Senators; election results; and contemporary commentary. Biographical sketches of the principal candidates for office and maps of the electoral districts in each state are provided, and the historical context of the documents is sketched in introductions and editorial notes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volume I, edited by Merrill Jensen and Robert A. Becker, was published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 1976. It contains the documents concerning the first federal elections in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, as well as the Confederation Congress&#x2019;s actions related to the Constitution and the elections. Volume II, published in 1984, covers the elections in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. Volume IV will cover the election of the president and vice president and the elections in North Carolina and Rhode Island.</p></p><p><p>Gordon DenBoer, editor of this present volume, received his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin Madison, where he studied with Professor Merrill Jensen. DenBoer is also editor of Volume II and IV of this series, and was research associate for the Atlas of Early American History (Princeton University Press, 1976). His work has appeared in the <i>Journal of American History</i>. Lucy Trumbull Brown, associate editor of this volume, is also associate editor for Volume II and IV. She is assistant editor of the Complete Works of Captain John Smith, and was for three years associated with the Institute for Early American History and Culture. Charles D. Hagermann served as editorial assistant for the current volume, as he did for Volume II and IV.</p>"</p><h2>For Sale - With Corpse</h2><p>When an estate agent is murdered Inspector Lambert and Sergeant Hook investigate a compact group of suspects consisting of his four employees, the wife of one of them, and a drunken derelict who knows a little too much.</p><p></p><h2>Birds Every Child Should Know</h2><p><p> </p><p>Originally published in 1907, <i>Birds Every Child Should Know</i> is a collection of storylike descriptions of more than one hundred birds commonly found in the United States. Neltje Blanchan's detailed descriptions of birds&#x2014;their physical attributes, calls, nesting and mating habits, and other behaviors&#x2014;are nothing less than enchanting, and some read almost like fairy tales. Take for instance the mockingbird's call:</p> <p>&#x201c;when the moonlight sheds a silvery radiance about every sleeping creature, the mockingbird sings to his mate such delicious music as only the European nightingale can rival. Perhaps the stillness of the hour, the beauty and fragrance of the place where the singer is hidden among the orange blossoms or magnolia, increase the magic of his almost pathetically sweet voice; but surely there is no lovelier sound in nature on this side of the sea.&#x201d;</p> <p>or the yellow warbler's nest:</p> <p>&#x201c;an exquisite little cradle of silvery plant fiber, usually shreds of milkweed stalk, grass, leaves, and caterpillar's silk, neatly lined with hair, feathers, and downy felt of fern fronds.&#x201d;</p> <p>Blanchan includes folk history (how Native Americans and southern slaves thwarted mosquitoes by hanging gourds to attract purple martins) as well as common threats to birds that foreshadow current dangers to avian life (the toll taken on songbirds by lighthouses and electric towers). Such informative details, along with the author's disarming enthusiasm for her subject, will charm adult bird-watchers as well as children.</p> <p>Cornelia Mutel's informative foreword places Blanchan's writing in the historical context of a turn-of-the-century environmental reawakening and burgeoning activism and research by women on behalf of dwindling bird populations.</p> <p></p></p><p>Neltje Blanchan was the pen name of Nellie Blanchan DeGraff Doubleday, wife of publishing giant Frank Nelson Doubleday. Under this pseudonym she published several books on gardening and birds.<p>&#x201c;This is a very nice book! Besides being pleasantly thick and crammed with information, it's an example of good writing for young readers. It's clear, not condescending, and does not read as especially dated for all its having been written almost a hundred years ago.<i>Birds Every Child Should Know</i> is a book many a child, and many an adult, should know today.&#x201d;&#x2014;Daniel Pinkwater</p></p><h2>Viper&#39;s Kiss: Bk. 2 (House of Serpents S.)</h2><p>The second in a gripping trilogy from R.A.

We&#x2019;ve set the standard that every map company has imitated but never duplicated. Our mission is to make you feel comfortable, to make you feel safe in a place where you&#x2019;ve never been before and to enable you to experience a familiar place more fully.<p>The company was founded in 1984 by Michael Brown, who had been in international publishing for many years, setting up subsidiaries for textbook publishers. In the 1970&#x2019;s, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving.</p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain.</p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool.</p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package.</p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work. More titles were added, each title requiring months of research and design.</p><p>Today, STREETWISE� produces over 130 titles for major destinations, regions and countries throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. We have grown from the back of a motorcycle to selling millions of maps around the world.</p><p>Yet each title is still painstakingly researched and updated. STREETWISE� is one of the only, if not THE only map company that conducts research by walking or driving an area to ensure accuracy. After all, what good is the map if what you hold in your hands doesn&#x2019;t match what you see on the street sign? This lengthy fact checking results in superior accuracy; in effect, we&#x2019;ve done the work, now you have the adventure.</p><p>In the end, it&#x2019;s not about the map, it&#x2019;s about getting out and finding your own authentic experience wherever you go. It&#x2019;s about being in a city or a region and discovering things that you never thought you would find. You can do this if you have confidence and you have confidence if you have a great map.

"Even when I am working on a novel, the images for stories keep coming."</p> <p>Considered by many to be the founder of modern Chicano literature, Rudolfo Anaya, best known for <em>Bless Me, Ultima</em> and other novels, has also authored a number of remarkable short stories. Now for the first time, these stories, representing thirty years of Anaya&#x2019;s writing, have been collected into a single volume. They constitute the best and most essential collection of Anaya&#x2019;s short story work.</p> <p>Unlike his novels, which range broadly over the American tapestry, Anaya&#x2019;s short stories focus on character and ethical questions in a regional setting&#x2015;from the harsh deserts of the American Southwest and northern Mexico to the lush tropical forests of Uxmal in the Yucat�n. These tales demonstrate Anaya&#x2019;s singular attitude toward fiction: that stories create myths to live and love by. "In the end the story has to speak for itself," Anaya writes. "Its purpose can be studied, but never fully known."</p> <p>With <em>The Man Who Could Fly and Other Stories</em>, the reader ventures deeply into the world of Rudolfo Anaya, a world of magic, mystery, harsh realities, and redemption.</p></p><p><p><b>Rudolfo Anaya </b>is Professor Emeritus of English at the University of New Mexico and award-winning author of numerous books including the classic <i>Bless Me, Ultima. </i>He has received myriad awards and honors for his work including Western Writers of America&#x2019;s Owen Wister Award (2018), the National Humanities Medal (2015), the National Medal of Arts (2001) and the Robert Kirsch Award for lifetime achievement from the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes (2012). He lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the Southwest has served as an inspiration for his writing throughout his life.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> This collection of 18 short stories spanning the past 30 years showcases Anaya's literary voice, at once innocent and omniscient, and rooted in the windswept <i>llanos</i> (plains) of New Mexico. Anaya, the award-winning Chicano author (<i>Bless Me, Ultima</i>), masterfully infuses his <i>cuentos</i>, or folktales, with mysticism and spirituality. The title story, for example, encapsulates a rancher's hard-learned lesson about magic. Anaya fluently weaves sensuality with small-town Catholicism in "Iliana of the Pleasure Dreams," about a teenage bride consumed by sexual fantasies. When the face of Christ supposedly appears on the church wall at sunset, she and her shy new husband connect over their inability to see the miracle. In "The Silence of the Llano," the collection's most moving story, the marital bliss of the <i>ranchero</i> Rafael is destroyed when his wife dies in childbirth, and he and his new daughter live separate, isolated lives under the same roof for 16 years, until another tragedy reunites them. "In Search of Epifano" features death as a benign figure, representing not only inevitability but also the resolution of a deep-seated desire unquenchable by anything on earth. Anaya's characters' longing shimmers off elegiac, deceptively simple prose, captivating in its aspiration and achievement. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Winnicott (1896-1971) was the first paediatrician in Britain to train as a psychoanalyst. In over forty years of clinical practice at the Paddington Green Children&#39;s Hospital, he brought unprecedented skill to the relatively new discipline of the psychoanalysis of children. His work is increasingly being regarded as one of the most influential contributions to psychoanalysis since Freud. His wife, Clare, was a renowned social worker.</p><h2>Let Freedom Sing</h2><p><em>On benches just for 'colored,'<br>black folks obeyed the rules.<br>Rosa Parks at the front of the bus,<br>she let her light shine.</em><br><br>In the 1950's and 1960's, the struggle for civil rights forever changed the landscape of America. In her debut Blue Apple book, Vanessa Newton candid images illuminate anew the inequality that affected Americans, young and old.<br><br>With an introduction by Ruby Bridges and text to the tune of "This Little Light of Mine," Newton's rich, mixed-media illustrations create a vivid message of hope.</p><p>Vanessa Newton was a little girl of only three when she found a box of crayons and wished to be an artist. She used many surfaces as canvases, such as white walls and the sides of the kitchen stove. At school, Vanessa met a teacher/artist who encouraged her and now she is living her dream. She is largely self-taught, though she has attended art school in New York. She lives in East Orange, New Jersey with her husband, their seven-year-old daughter, and a fat cat named Kirby.PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;Music played a major role in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. One of the songs, <i>This Little Light of Mine</i>, serves as a recurring focal point in this book. The well-designed book features large, colorful, deceptively simple images highlighting significant dates and events in the African-American struggle for equality. The illustrations are thought-provoking and sure to prompt questions such as, why, in one spread, the children on one page are black and entering a school, or drinking from a water fountain, while on the opposite page, all the children are white and walking toward another school, and drinking from a separate fountain? Text is kept to a minimum, with a few carefully chosen words to describe what is visually represented on each page. For example, one page of a spread reads, "February 1, 1960. The Greensboro Four"&#x2014;followed by their names. The facing page reads, "Students at lunch counters&#x2014;/They hoped to be served. As the Greensboro Four sat waiting,/they let their lights shine." While this is a good introduction to the topic, it sometimes presupposes prior knowledge of, or exposure to, African-American history. Pair this offering with <i>This Little Light of Mine</i>, illustrated by E.B. Lewis's (2005), and/or Ashley Bryan's <i>Let It Shine: Three Favorite Spirituals</i> (2007, both S &amp; S), both of which include verses and musical notes.&#x2014;<i>Mary N.

There must be more to life than this." It is this sense that often brings people to the practice of Zen. By turning to Zen, they acknowledge that this "something" lies not in externals, but rather in seeking to transcend desire and attachment. The journey toward that transcendence begins with questioning, and questions will be part of the path until awakening is attained.<br><br>In <i>What More do You Want?</i> a fascinating new book by renowned Zen master Albert Low, he addresses some of the questions students have posed about the practice of Zen: Why do we practice? Why should we seek to understand our reasons for practicing? How can we distinguish between true and false practice? What is awakening? In addition, Low shares with his readers four <i>teishos</i>&#x2014;talks that comment on a text or koan in order to enhance meditation practice&#x2014;on <i>zazen</i> or seated meditation, on pain and suffering, and on the very nature of practice itself.

But all we hear is static.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"It's OK, Lloyd," I say. "They can't pick us up with these mountains obstructing our radio transmission. We usually make contact with them around Owens Valley."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I scan the instrument panel. The altimeter reads 12,000 feet above sea level, a safe altitude in this part of California's Sierra Nevada, even though the tallest peaks here rise to heights greater than 14,000 feet. Our airspeed is 145 mph, and our heading, as we fly toward the Inyo Mountains and Death Valley, is 020 degrees. Holding the plane straight, I adjust the elevator trim, a wheel on the floor that helps level the plane in flight, and Maule N5629-Juliet smooths out.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Boy, it's cold up here," Lloyd mutters through chattering teeth. "But I love it," he adds with an ear-to-ear grin. It's clear by the look on his face that Lloyd Matsumoto, a fifty-seven-year-old drug and alcohol counselor for the city of Long Beach, is having the time of his life. It's his first trip and, captivated by all these awesome views, he is not sure what to photograph first, so he snaps photos at everything he sees.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Cold air is seeping into the cockpit, so I check the exterior air temperature gauge. It reads ten below zero. No wonder I feel chilled. I pull off a glove and zip up my jacket.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Also penetrating the cockpit is the deafening roar of the 235- horsepower engine and the chopping rhythm of the propeller. Fortunately, our headsets muffle most of this extraneous noise and the three of us can communicate easily through the onboard intercom system.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Which way this time?" asks Waverly "Wave" Hatch from the seat behind me and Lloyd. Unlike Lloyd, Wave is an experienced flyer. He knows that from our present position, we can head over to Yosemite, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, or Owens Valley. From Mount Whitney we can fly to Lee Vining, a small airport resting at an elevation of 6802 feet, slightly north of Mammoth on the shores of Mono Lake close to the Nevada state line.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"Why don't we head east and check out Mount Whitney and then go on to Owens Valley?" I suggest.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I scan the skies for other aircraft. Not one in sight. What an extraordinary view. Although Alaska can boast the sixteen highest peaks in the United States, including the 20,320-foot Mount McKinley, California's Mount Whitney, rising to 14,494 feet, is the tallest peak in the lower forty-eight states. Discovered in 1864 by the American geologist Josiah Dwight Whitney, this towering peak rises at the eastern border of Sequoia National Park. Mount Whitney and the surrounding 13,000-foot peaks are magnets for climbers and hikers from all over the world. From the air, one can see the sides of Mount Whitney have been burnished by ancient glaciers that once flowed down to the valleys of the Kern and Owens rivers. These days no glaciers remain, but a ten-foot snow base, from recent snowstorms, now blankets the mountain.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Not more than a hundred miles from the lofty Mount Whitney is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere, Death Valley, an area the size of Connecticut, and in the summer the hottest spot in North America. Tourists flock to be photographed alongside a sign on the desert floor that reads "BADWATER, 282 feet/66 meters below sea level." At the peak of the summer season, temperatures reach 125 degrees and more.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This remote area is brimming with wildlife. As we fly over the mountains and across the high desert floor, we can spot deer and coyote in the skag brush and in the ravines cut out of the earth by the hard rains that flood the desert floor. Mount Whitney's windswept summit is home to hardy flocks of rosy finches. When they are not looking for handouts from hikers, these tame little brown and pink birds devour the insects that have been blown up the slope from lower elevations or have become trapped in melting ice or frozen on the surface of the snowfields. More visible in and around the lakeshore are the sage grouse, palm warblers, tundra swans, hawks, owls, ducks, Western bluebirds, American pipits, and indigo buntings in an array of sizes and colors. As soon as they hear the roar of the plane over the lake, they flock together in tight formation and their movements suddenly become sharp, erratic, and ungraceful.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The Maule's reflection in Mono Lake below is calming and gives me a sense of inner peace. This is one of the true pleasures of flying. Framing the view are clouds of all shapes and sizes. I scan the instrument panel, paying special attention to our fuel consumption. With a piston-driven engine that has a carburetor instead of fuel injection, the pilot must adjust the fuel and air mixture to achieve maximum engine performance, using the Lean Mixture knob. When the knob is pulled out the fuel is reduced, making the mixture "leaner." Push the knob in and the mixture is enriched. If the flow of fuel is excessive, the engine underperforms, horsepower is reduced, and fuel is consumed unnecessarily.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The plane is equipped with three transparent doors, two up front and one in back. Most people who have flown in the Maule remember the "greenhouse" visibility these three Plexiglas doors provide. To some, the Maule is a flying glass-bottom boat.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>What we see all around us is breathtaking. The majestic mountain peaks are covered with freshly fallen snow. The Spanish settlers named the Sierras for Spain's highest mountain range, the Sierra Nevada, which means "snowy range." Here and there, we can see giant sequoias rising a hundred feet or more above the white earth.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I follow the Kern River with its frozen waterfalls and gigantic pillars of ice. Every time I pass here I'm inspired again to take up ice climbing. Then, after I gaze across this staggering wilderness, so rugged and frozen, I'm glad to be flying up here at 12,000 feet where I am able to take the easy way out of this wilderness by a mere turn of the steering yoke. This section of the river is bounded by steep, rocky canyon walls. At the river's edge, huge boulders covered with snow and ice are positioned like sentinels guarding the rapids.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As I assimilate the mountainous landscape, I continually check for a place where I could turn the craft around, or ditch it should that be necessary. It would be a tough crash landing out here in this wilderness. I look for a clearing, a patch of white. Unknown to Lloyd and Wave, whenever I fly, I frequently scan for such a clearing, even though I am confident I'll never need one.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"OK, Wave," I say. "In fifteen minutes I'll switch tanks and start burning fuel from the other wing."</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"We're right on schedule," says Wave.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In order to equalize the weight in the wings so that the plane will fly straight and level with little input from the controls, I have to burn off the fuel equally in each wing. This is accomplished by setting a stopwatch at one-hour marks, then switching the fuel petcock from wing to wing.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I am chilled to the bone. "These Maule heaters ain't worth shit," I shout out in frustration to no one in particular. Part of the problem is that the Maule's Plexiglas doors are not adequately sealed to prevent cold air from seeping into the cockpit. Moreover, I'm not adequately dressed for the cold. All I have on is a T-shirt, a hooded sweatshirt, a lightweight double-layer ski jacket, briefs, long johns, jeans, gym socks, and sneakers. Fortunately, I have my Gore-Tex ski gloves and sunglasses to protect my eyes from the intense sun rays. And for sentimental reasons, I have my personal Maule cap, a white baseball cap with a picture of a Maule embroidered on it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"If you want, we can make that heater work a whole lot better," says Wave. He not only is a skilled pilot and professional aircraft mechanic, but is gifted at making and fixing anything. I yearn for the day when I can fly my Maule through cold country with the luxury of a good heater on board.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It is so cold in the cockpit that each of us exhales thick puffs of vapor with each breath. I pull up my sweatshirt hood. Within moments I feel a bit warmer. By contrast, the prop and engine love the cold. Colder air is denser, and the prop bites it better. I check the clock. It is only 10:25 A.M., an ideal time for mountain flying because the air is still dense, crisp, and cool. In just a few hours, the sun will start to warm the air and thin it out.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>No matter the terrain, I always pay attention to the slightest change in atmosp...</p></p><h2>Meier &amp; Partners.

S. Grant summoned thirty-three-year-old Major General Philip Sheridan to lead George Gordon Meade's cavalry in the resilient yet seemingly lethargic Army of the Potomac. Sheridan's fiery determination and uncompromising demand for performance quickly gained him the upper hand against Confederate cavalry forces in Virginia. He surrounded himself with men who could deliver glory and victory, including George A. Custer, George Crook, and Wesley Merritt. Together, they directed the most potent fighting force during the war's final year and went on to influence the Army into the twentieth century.<br><br>In this exciting new work, David Coffey tells the compelling story of Sheridan and his lieutenants&#x2015;exploring their relationships and examining their roles in the Civil War and beyond. As he takes the reader through the battles of 1864 and 1865, Coffey provides a unique insight into the formation of the martial brotherhood that dominated the American military establishment for almost forty years.</p><p>David Coffey is chair of the Department of History and Philosophy at the University of Tennessee at Martin, where he teaches U.S. and Latin American history. His books include John Bell Hood and the Struggle for Atlanta and Soldier Princess: The Life and Legend of Agnes Salm-Salm in North America, 1861&#x2013;1867.<i>Sheridan's Lieutenants</i> is a fine operational history of the forces commanded by General Phil Sheridan in the last year of the Civil War. David Coffey is obviously a partisan of Sheridan but is alert to his shortcomings as well as his strengths. The book's solid research, reasoned judgments, and able writing will make it appeal to Civil War buffs as well as scholars. Coffey's description of the final race to Appomattox, in particular, creates a sense of excitement that makes a familiar story seem new. (Michael D. Pierce, Tarleton State University)<br><br>Professor David Coffey has written a concise, interesting, and fast-paced study of the evolution and accomplishments of the Union cavalry in the East that is useful to any student of the last year of the Civil War in Virginia. (Eric J. Wittenberg, author of Little Phil: An Assessment of the Civil War Generalship of Philip H. Sheridan)<br><br>During the final year of the American Civil War Phil Sheridan struck several of the key blows that brought the Confederacy to its knees. Controversial and colorful, the fiery cavalryman often ran roughshod over friend as well as foe; to this day his generalship remains a source of debate. David Coffey's study should raise a few eyebrows while enriching our understanding of Sheridan and the men who fought with him, including the flamboyant George Armstrong Custer, the hard-bitten Tom Devin, and the steady Wesley Merritt. (Brooks D. Simpson, Arizona State University, author of Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph over Adversity)<br><br>Coffey knows his territory from thorough research (see the fine, annotated bibliography) and has written clearly, making even fast-moving mounted engagements intelligible. An admirable set of portraits . . . concludes the book's catalog of virtues. (Roland Green <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Coffey packs each page with detail that adds to our knowledge of a man, his command, and the sites where they did great things. <i>Sheridan's Lieutenants</i> is worth more in historical value than its actual price, as it provides great scholarly insight into a lesser known piece of Civil War history. Historians and general readers should consider placing this work on their reading lists.

BBC2&#39;s major TV show THE LAST KINGDOM is based on the first two books in the series. From the day it was stolen from me I had dreamed of recapturing Bebbanburg. The great fort was built on a rock that was almost an island, it was massive, it could only be approached on land by a single narrow track - and it was mine. Britain is in a state of uneasy peace. Northumbria&#39;s Viking ruler, Sigtryggr, and Mercia&#39;s Saxon Queen Aethelflaed have agreed a truce. And so England&#39;s greatest warrior, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, at last has the chance to take back the home his traitorous uncle stole from him so many years ago - and which his scheming cousin still occupies. But fate is inexorable and the enemies Uhtred has made and the oaths he has sworn combine to distract him from his dream of recapturing Bebbanburg. New enemies enter into the fight for England&#39;s kingdoms: the redoubtable Constantin of Scotland seizes an opportunity for conquest and leads his armies south. Britain&#39;s precarious peace threatens to turn into a war of annihilation. But Uhtred is determined that nothing, neither the new enemies nor the old foes who combine against him, will keep him from his birthright. He is the Lord of Bebbanburg, but he will need all the skills he has learned in a lifetime of war to make his dream come true.</p><p>Bernard Cornwell was born in London, raised in Essex and worked for the BBC for eleven years before meeting Judy, his American wife.

I thought they were going to rush the stage!"--FIRST MOM demonstrates why the nation first fell in love with Barbara Bush, and why we continue to adore her today. <br>The book also includes a special-edition DVD of the A&amp;E Biography "Barbara Bush: First Mom," which brings some of these delightful quotes and stories to life.</p><p>Almost forty years ago, Bill Adler edited The Kennedy Wit, a New York Times top-ten bestseller for twenty-two weeks. More recently, Adler edited bestseller The Uncommon Wisdom of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.Wife to the 41st president, mother to the 43rd president and direct descendent of the 14th president, Franklin Pierce, Barbara Pierce Bush is uniquely poised to offer an intimate view of the East Wing of American politics. Prefaced with a brief biographical introduction, the wide collection of quotes offers insight on her love, marriage, literacy, weight struggles, life in the White House and more, in the frank and jocular tone that won her fans well beyond her husband&#x2019;s Republican base. Editor Adler does not divide the dull from the divine, mixing amusing quips ("I married the first man I ever kissed. When I tell this to my children, they just about throw up") with flat-liners ("So many great things have happened to me because I married well"). Released in an election year, the book&#x2019;s fluffy fare will please Bush fans, but leave anyone interested in the former First Lady&#x2019;s true feelings on real and current issues seriously dissatisfied.

First opened in 1895, Delmonico Restaurant and Bar in New Orleans reopened its doors a century later to tremendous acclaim as Emeril's Delmonico. In his latest cookbook, America's favorite celebrity chef presents a collection of recipes that are adapted and simplified for home cooks, featuring a combination of Creole classics and Emeril's kicked-up creations. </p><p>Emeril's Delmonico is full of recipes for hearty, innovative food steeped in New Orleans style. Illustrated with both contemporary full-color and vintage black-and-white photographs, Emeril's Delmonico paints a lively, evocative portrait of Emeril's classic cuisine and the rich culinary history of New Orleans.</p></p><p>First opened in 1895, Delmonico Restaurant and Bar in New Orleans was a Creole cooking landmark. Acquired by celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse in 1995, the new Delmonico's features classic dishes as well as Lagasse's riffs on traditional fare. Emeril's Delmonico offers 130-plus recipes from the restaurant--favorite dishes like St. Paul's Seafood Gumbo, Shrimp Remoulade, and Chicken Rocambeau (prepared with marchand du vin <i>and</i> hollandaise sauces), and "newer" fare such as Chorizo and Manchego Cheese Omelet, and Lump Crabmeat and Brie Strudels with Herbsaint Cream Glaze. This is, for the most part, rich, saucy cooking that requires a commitment of time--and in many cases, ready cash--to accomplish. Though the recipes aren't difficult, many entail multiple preparations (as well as Lagasse-brand products) to complete, and are probably best reserved for weekend cooking and eating. With an attractive section on desserts that includes Velvet Chocolate Tort with Clear Orange Caramel Sauce and Delmonico's famed baked Alaska (as well as a cr�me br�l�e recipe that directs cooks to partially burn its sugar glaze--diners beware!), color photos, and sections on drinks and brunch dishes, the book will appeal to Lagasse fans who want either to fantasize about the master's cooking, or give themselves a kitchen workout. Those interested in Creole cooking, one of America's great inventions, should also take a look. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i><p>Emeril Lagasse is a chef, restaurateur, and the author of eighteen bestselling cookbooks, including the recent <em>Emeril's Kicked-Up Sandwiches</em> and <em>Sizzling Skillets and Other One Pot Wonders</em>. He is the proprietor of thirteen award-winning restaurants across the country and is the host of <em>The Originals with Emeril</em> and <em>Emeril's Florida</em>, both airing on the Cooking Channel. He has been the food correspondent for ABC's <em>Good Morning America</em> for fourteen years. In 2002, Emeril established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation to support children's educational programs that inspire and mentor young people through the culinary arts and promote nutrition and healthy eating.</p></p><h2>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</h2><p><p><strong>"One of the funniest and most unusual books of the year....Gross, educational, and unexpectedly sidesplitting."&#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></strong></p><i>Stiff</i> is an oddly compelling, often hilarious exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadavers&#x2015;some willingly, some unwittingly&#x2015;have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They've tested France's first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender reassignment surgery, cadavers have been there alongside surgeons, making history in their quiet way.<br><br> In this fascinating, ennobling account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries&#x2015;from the anatomy labs and human-sourced pharmacies of medieval and nineteenth-century Europe to a human decay research facility in Tennessee, to a plastic surgery practice lab, to a Scandinavian funeral directors' conference on human composting. In her droll, inimitable voice, Roach tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.</p><p>Mary Roach is the author of Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War, Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, and Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. Her writing has appeared in Outside, Wired, National Geographic, and the New York Times Magazine, among others. She lives in Oakland, California.In case you were wondering, some human cadavers do lead active lives after death. For centuries, many have served medicine, magicians, and cannibals in various noble and grossly ignoble ways. Reader Shelly Frasier captures the trenchant wit of Roach's text, which at times is hilariously funny and always appropriately sardonic. Whether we're attending a gruesome autopsy or wandering down a memory lane of corpses, we find ghastly factoids and the people responsible for them around every corner. Not recommended for dinnertime listening, but a must for the curious living, who will find a jocular companion in narrator Frasier.

C. Fields</h2><p>The first biography in decades (and the only accurate one) of the comic genius behind Larson E. Whipsnade, Egbert Souse, Eustace McGargle, and other immortal examples of the American male at bay. Everyone seems to know the story of W. C. Fields, the curmudgeon of classic film comedy--his Dickensian childhood in Philadelphia, the numerous bank accounts opened around the world under outlandish names, and so on. All entertaining--and all completely untrue. Simon Louvish&#39;s meticulously researched and wonderfully entertaining biography is the first one to disentangle the facts from the pack of lies and myths mischievously nurtured by Fields himself. Louvish lovingly traces the origin of Fields&#39;s comedy in his self-authored vaudeville sketches and follows his progress from the stage (where he was renowned as the world greatest juggler) to silent screen to the talkies--including such howlingly funny films as The Bank Dick, My Little Chickadee, and You Can&#39;t Cheat an Honest Man. He highlights his tragic struggles against studio heads, censorship, alcoholism, and illness--in the course of which he created some of the greatest gems of film humor. Man on the Flying Trapeze is the story of an artist whose finest creation was himself--a fully achieved, imaginary person who finally subsumed his creator, to the immense benefit of us all.</p><p>Simon Louvish is the author of nine critically acclaimed novels. He teaches film at the London International Film School and writes frequently about the Golden Age of comedy.Louvish does a heroic job of filling in Fields's life. -- <i>New York Times Book Review, Katharine Whittemore</i><br><br>Mr. Louvish, who teaches at the London International Film School, must have worked long and hard on this biography of W. C. Fields. Fields was a superb comedian, but he was also a mischievous, amusing, and habitual liar. The hard-drinking curmudgeon who hated babies, kicked dogs, and stashed money in unlikely places under fantastic aliases was a deliberate invention, except for the drinking. Fields's biographer is faced with the problem of replacing entertaining fantasy with mere fact, and Mr. Louvish surmounts it very well indeed, with histories of vaudeville (Fields began as a juggler), of the extravagancies of Ziegfeld Follies, and of the uncertainties of early movie-making, while enlivening his text with effective quotations and sketches of everyone concerned--a gallery of great clowns. The reader gets a sound view of Fields and of his world. -- <i>The Atlantic Monthly, Phoebe-Lou Adams</i><br><br>Simon Louvish ... teaches at the London International Film School, and in <i>Man on the Flying Trapeze</i> he nicely regales us with many vaudevillian stories.... Louvish tells us less about Fields's films. This is a flaw, though admittedly the more famous ones have been much parsed, and many of the smaller ones are now lost. Still, there are the stories. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Katharine Whittemore</i><br><br>Simon Louvish, who is too young and too English to understand the narrow and unforgiving America that shaped (and outraged) Fields and is too dull-witted to imagine it ... [reduces] the profoundly authentic misanthropy of a figure he inexplicably adores into mere curmudgeonliness, which he appears to think will play better in our squishier age. A writer of astonishing ineptitude--are there no editors left who check usage and syntax?--he's also the kind of biographer who thinks that if he notes who was in the White House at a turning point in his subject's life, he has discharged his obligations to social history. -- <i>Los Angeles Times Sunday Book Review, Richard Shickel</i><br><br>This dogged biography of the irascible, bulbous-nosed comic sweeps away the myth of his hardscrabble youth, cruel father, and life as a bitter, unfriendly star steeped in isolation and alcohol. (Well, the bit about the alcohol is true.).... <i>Man on the Flying Trapeze</i> does what an artist's biography should do: It makes you itch to view his work again (in this case, classics like <i>The Bank Dick</i> and <i>Never Give a Sucker an Even Break</i>). -- <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><h2>Ambitious Brew : The Story of American Beer</h2><p>In the first-ever history of American beer, Maureen Ogle tells its epic story, from the immigrants who invented it to the upstart microbrewers who revived it. &nbsp;Beer might seem as American as baseball, but that has not always been true: Rum and whiskey were the drinks of choice in the 1840s, with only a few breweries making heavy, yeasty English ale. When a wave of German immigrants arrived in the middle of the nineteenth century, they promptly set about re-creating the pleasures of the <i>biergartens</i> they had left behind. <br><br>&nbsp;Just fifty years later, the American-style lager beer they invented was the nation&#x2019;s most popular beverage&#x2014;and brewing was the nation&#x2019;s fifth-largest industry, ruled over by fabulously wealthy titans Frederick Pabst and Adolphus Busch. But when anti-German sentiments aroused by World War I fed the flames of the temperance movement (one activist even declared that &#x201c;the worst of all our German enemies are Pabst, Schlitz, Blatz, and Miller&#x201d;), Prohibition was the result. In the wake of its repeal, brewers replaced flavor with innovations like marketing and lite beer, setting the stage for a generation of microbrewers whose ambitions reshaped the drink.<br><br>&nbsp;Grab a glass and settle in for the surprising story behind your favorite pint.</p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2006, 978-0-15-101012-7 / 0-15-101012-9"From lager-making German immigrants to today's microbrew-meisters, a sudsy, briskly told survey of American beer."--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Grab a pint and settle back with <i>Ambitious Brew</i>?the fascinating history of American beer.

An extraordinary city, London grew from a backwater in the Classical age into an important medieval city, a significant Renaissance urban center, and a modern colossus. Roy Porter paints a detailed landscape--from the grid streets and fortresses of Julius Caesar and William the Conqueror to the medieval, walled "most noble city" of churches, friars, and crown and town relationships. Within the crenelated battlements, manufactures and markets developed and street-life buzzed. </p><p> London's profile in 1500 was much as it was at the peak of Roman power. The city owed its courtly splendor and national pride of the Tudor Age to the phenomenal expansion of its capital. It was the envy of foreigners, the spur of civic patriotism, and a hub of culture, architecture, great literature, and new religion. From the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries, London experienced a cruel civil war, raging fires, enlightenment in thought, government, and living, and the struggle and benefits of empire. From the lament that "London was but is no more" to "you, who are to stand a wonder to all Years and ages...a phoenix," London became an elegant, eye-catching, metropolitan hub. It was a mosaic, Porter shows, that represented the shared values of a people--both high and low born--at work and play. </p><p> London was and is a wonder city, a marvel. Not since ancient times has there been such a city--not eternal, but vibrant, living, full of a free people ever evolving. In this transcendent book, Roy Porter touches the pulse of his hometown and makes it our own, capturing London's fortunes, people, and imperial glory with brio and wit. </p></p><p><b>Roy Porter</b> is Professor of Medical History at University College, London, and Research Fellow at the Wellcome Institute.[<i>London</i>] deserves to be an instant classic. True London addicts will supplement it with the new edition of <i>The London Encyclopedia</i> by Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert, which Porter rightly calls "truly magnificent," but for those looking for a one-volume social history of the city, Porter's book could hardly be bettered. (Michael Elliott <i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>Lavishly illustrated and handsomely produced for no more than the price of most basic hardbacks these days, <i>London</i> is a treat for all lovers of London. (James Bowman <i>Washington Times</i>)<br><br>In his stunningly successful look at London between the Elizabeths, Roy Porter, a professor of medical history at University College, London, examines his home city not as some stretched-out cadaver but as a form evolving over time: sometimes a cancer, sometimes a monster, a heart, a stripling giant, an unknown disease, a fungus and also always a force, sometimes inorganic, a great tidal sea, a gravitational black hole, an imperial sun...History, not heritage, preoccupies Mr. Porter. His book makes no effort to chronicle the monuments of London building or rank masterpieces of architecture, although it puts coaching taverns and cathedrals into broader contexts...And, most happily, it is not ordinary, late-20th-century urban history, either, for it is acutely, indeed gracefully, written and it transcends the pettiness of scholars jamming facts into theories. (John R. Stilgoe <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>In this big book, London-born Roy Porter presents a social historian's guide to his native city. It is a great piling up of information and contemporary observation from the years that span the two Elizabeths. Porter's aim, which he achieves splendidly, is to show the interaction between the city's people, its economy and the built environment...This truly fine book includes many excellent illustrations. (Katherine A. Powers <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i>)<br><br>This is much the best and bravest thing [Porter] has yet written. It is important because it makes the whole sweep of London's unique history comprehensible and accessible in a way that no previous writer has ever managed to accomplish...For cities, like nations, can only be understood in an historical perspective. It is that perspective which this book so brilliantly provides. In more senses than one, it is a capital history. (David Cannadine <i>The Independent</i>)<br><br>If you want to know how a great urban area developed, look no further than Roy Porter's exhaustive--but never exhausting--history of London...[An] excellent study. (<i>Dallas Morning News</i>)<br><br>[A] rich and evocative portrayal of London's teeming life...[A]ny interested historian or educated tourist who wishes to come to London to form a personal opinion should buy Porter's wonderful evocation of this "most possible form of life." (Martin Daunton <i>American Historical Review</i>)</p><h2>The Me in the Mirror</h2><p>Writer, activist and artist Connie Panzarino was born in 1947 with the rare disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type III, formerly called Amytonia Congenita. Throughout a childhood filled with both pain and joy, she strove to define herself: "I knew I was different. Now I had a name for the difference, like being Italian or Jewish. I was an Amytonia. I didn't understand if that meant that I would never walk, or if all it meant was lack of muscle tone. I didn't know that most children with this disease die before they're five years old." <br><br>In this deeply moving and eloquent memoir, Connie Panzarino describes her decades of struggle and triumph, her relationships with family members and long-time lover Ron Kovic (author of <i>Born on the Fourth of July</i>), her eventual turn to lesbianism, and her years of pioneering work in the disability rights movement. <br><br>Filled with spirit, passion and defiance, <i>The Me In The Mirror</i> tells the story of a remarkable life.</p><p><b>Connie Panzarino</b> (1947-2001) was a writer, activist, and artist.Panzarino is a severely disabled lesbian activist and art therapist, and her story is scary in its forthright honesty. Born with a rare progressive muscular disease, she has lived a life in which virtually no achievement is small and nothing is taken for granted. She speaks uncompromisingly about the pain of ill-advised childhood braces, the guilt at disappointing her parents, waiting for assistance with toileting, and being barred from elementary school and the day-to-day companionship of other children. Dependent on a mother with two additional children, one of them born with the same malady, Panzarino well communicates the great frustration, anguish, and turmoil she endured during her fight for education, employment, a usable wheelchair, reliable aides, transportation, accessibility, and, ultimately, a life of her own in which she could realize personal and political growth. A longtime friend and sometime lover of disability rights activist Ron Kovic, Panzarino eventually turned to lesbianism and political activism. She established Beechwood, a communal living environment for disabled women, where she continues her work as a therapist, writer, and activist. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>The Other Side Of The Sky</h2><p>Paperback book The Other Side of the Sky by Arthur C Clarke</p><p></p><h2>The Inheritance and Other Stories</h2><p>Megan Lindholm (Wizard of the Pigeons) writes tightly constructed SF and fantasy with a distinctly contemporary feel. Robin Hobb (Assassin's Quest) writes sprawling, multi-volume fantasies set in imaginary realms. These two writers, apparently so different, are, of course, the same person, each reflecting an aspect of a single multifaceted imagination.<br><br>Inheritance gathers the best of Hobb and Lindholm's shorter fiction into one irreplaceable volume containing ten stories and novellas (seven by Lindholm, three by Hobb), together with a revealing introduction and extensive, highly readable story notes. The Lindholm section leads off with the Hugo and Nebula-nominated novella 'A Touch of Lavender,' a powerful account of love, music, poverty, and addiction set against an extended encounter between human and alien societies. Other memorable entries include 'Cut,' a reflection on the complex consequences of freedom, and the newly published 'Drum Machine,' an equally absorbing meditation on the chaotic nature of the creative impulse. Two of Robin Hobb's contributions revisit the world of her popular Live Traders series. 'Homecoming' enlarges the earlier history of those novels through the journal entries of Lady Carillion Carrock, while 'The Inheritance' concerns a disenfranchised young woman who comes to understand the true nature of her grandmother's legacy. And in 'Cat's Meat,' a long and wonderful story written expressly for this collection, an embattled single mother reclaims her life with the help of a gifted--and utterly ruthless--cat.<br><br>Inheritance offers the best of two separate but related fictional worlds. Whatever their differences, the Hobb and Lindholm stories have certain crucial elements in common: their intelligence, their attention to detail, and their instant, almost effortless accessibility. Together, these beautifully crafted tales constitute a unique and important collection that offers both offers both intellectual pleasure and pure narrative excitement on virtually every page.</p><p><p>A treasure trove of tales from a master storyteller&#x2014;the first to feature works written under both her pseudonyms, Robin Hobb and Megan Lindholm . . .</p><p><em>The Inheritance</em></p><p>Before she became an acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, Robin Hobb received resounding critical praise for work written under the name Megan Lindholm.

The collection is comprised of three generous offerings from Robin Hobb, including the title story, which makes its U.S. debut here, and a brand-new tale, "Cat's Meat."

Sansom once again asserts himself as the master of the historical novel.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1952. Twelve years have passed since Churchill lost to the appeasers and Britain surrendered to Nazi Germany. The press, radio and television are tightly controlled. British Jews face ever greater constraints. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Churchill's Resistance soldiers on. And in a Birmingham mental hospital, fragile scientist Frank Muncaster holds a secret that could alter the balance of the global struggle forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Servant David Fitzgerald, a spy for the Resistance, is given the mission to rescue Frank and get him out of the country. Hard on his heels is Gestapo agent Gunther Hoth, a brilliant, implacable hunter of men, who soon has Frank, along with David's innocent wife, Sarah, directly in his sights.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.J. Sansom's literary thriller <i>Winter in Madrid</i> earned him comparisons to Graham Greene, Sebastian Faulks and Ernest Hemingway. Now, in the first alternative history epic from Sansom in the tradition of Robert Harris's <i>Fatherland</i> and Stephen King's <i>11/22/63</i>, Sansom doesn't just recreate the past--he reinvents it. In a spellbinding tale of suspense, oppression and poignant love, <i>Dominion </i>dares to explore how, in moments of crisis, history can turn on the decisions of a few brave men and women--the secrets they keep and the bonds they share.</p><p>C.J.

A civil war was being fought between the Napa Valley, which epitomized elitism, prestige and wealthy excess, and the neighboring Sonoma Valley, a rag-tag bohemian enclave so stubbornly backward that rambunctious chickens wandered freely through town. But the antics really began when new-money invaders began pushing out Sonoma&#x2019;s poets and painters to make way for luxury resorts and trophy houses that seemed a parody of opulence. <i>A Tale of Two Valleys</i> captures these stranger-than-fiction locales with the wit of a Tom Wolfe novel and uncorks the hilarious absurdities of life among the wine world&#x2019;s glitterati.<br>Deutschman found that on the weekends the wine country was like a bunch of gracious hosts smiling upon their guests, but during the week the families feuded with each other and their neighbors like the Hatfields and McCoys. Napa was a comically exclusive club where the super-rich fought desperately to get in. Sonoma&#x2019;s colorful free spirits and iconoclasts were wary of their bohemia becoming the next playground for the rapacious elite. So, led by a former taxicab driver and wine-grape picker, a cheese merchant, and an artist who lived in a barn surrounded by wild peacocks, they formed a populist revolt to seize power and repel the rich invaders.<br>Deutschman&#x2019;s cast of characters brims with eccentrics, egomaniacs, and a mysterious man in black who crashed the elegant Napa Valley Wine Auction before proceeding to pay a half-million dollars for a single bottle. What develops is nothing less than a battle for the good life, a clash between old and new, the struggle for the soul of one of America&#x2019;s last bits of paradise. A dishy glimpse behind the scenes of a West Coast wonderland, <i>A Tale of Two Valleys</i> makes for intoxicating reading.</p><p>Advance Praise for <br><i>A Tale of Two Valleys</i><br>&#x201c;Intoxicating . . .

And yet, in making any general judgement of this kind one is in danger of forgetting the manifold variety of humanity and its mental life. There are certain men from whom their contemporaries do not withhold veneration, although their greatness rests on attributes and achievements which are completely foreign to the aims and ideals of the multitude. One might well be inclined to suppose that after all it is only a minority who appreciate these great men, while the majority cares nothing for them. But the discrepancy between men&#39;s opinions and their behaviour is so wide and their desires so many-sided that things are probably not so simple.--Sigmund Freud</p><p>4 1-hour cassettesSigmund Freud (1856&#x2013;1939), an Austrian psychiatrist and the founder of psychoanalysis, isconsidered the most influential psychological theorist of the twentieth century and the author of The Interpretation of Dreams.<br><br>Steven Crossley has recorded over two hundred audiobooks and has won multiple AudioFile Earphones Awards.

Mrs. Quimby has gone back to work so that Mr. Quimby can return to school, and Ramona is expected to be good for Mrs. Kemp while her parents are away, to be brave enough to ride the school bus by herself, and to put up with being teased by Danny the Yard Ape. In Ramona&#x2019;s world, being eight isn&#x2019;t easy, but it&#x2019;s never dull!&nbsp;<br></p></p><p>From the first day of third grade, when Ramona Quimby meets her eventual nemesis Yard Ape, life moves on at its usual wild pace--usual for the boisterous Ramona, that is. Soon she is accidentally squashing a raw egg into her hair at the school cafeteria, being forced to play Uncle Rat with her annoying young neighbor, and, worst of all, throwing up in her classroom. The responsibilities of an 8-year-old are sometimes daunting, especially in a family that is trying to squeak by while the father goes back to school. But Ramona is full of too much vim and vigor to ever be down for long. <p> In her second Newbery Honor Book about Ramona (the first was <i>Ramona and Her Father</i>), Beverly Cleary presents another slice of the Quimby family life. Author of more than two dozen children's books, Cleary has a true knack for understanding the tangle of thoughts and emotions in a child's mind and heart. Empathic, witty, and astute, she has earned many other awards, including the Newbery Medal for <i>Dear Mr. Henshaw</i>. Alan Tiegreen's clever line drawings have charmed countless readers of Cleary's books over the years, and his style is now inextricably tied to hers.

The Wellness Nutrition Counter is different in that it&#39;s both easy to use and comprehensive. You&#39;ll find complete nutritional information for over 6,000 foods, including brand name products. Plus, there&#39;s a chapter describing vitamins and minerals - what they do, how much you need, and what happens when you get too little, or too much - and listing the leading sources of each nutrient. The book is clearly organized and contains a comprehensive index, so you&#39;ll be able to quickly locate what you&#39;re looking for.</p><p>Sheldon Margen, M.D., is Professor Emeritus of Public Health and Nutrition in the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley.By the editors of the University of California at Berkeley <i>Wellness Letter</i> and the Wellness Nutrition Center, this is a welcome addition to consumer-oriented nutrition guides as an explanation of the importance of knowing what's in the foods we eat. Written in language that is clear and nontechnical, the<i> </i>volume is well laid out and easy to understand. Perhaps the most important information can be found in the opening sections, which explain the basics of a healthy diet, including the building blocks of nutrition, nutrient needs, 15 keys to a healthy diet, and how to read a food label.<p>The text is divided into three sections. "Vitamins and Minerals" describes the individual nutrients and provides a list of leading sources of each. "Foods, General" supplies the nutritional values of whole fresh and nonbranded foods based on the USDA Handbook 8 used by nutrition professionals. "Foods, Brand Name" includes nutritional data that come from the manufacturers on a variety of brand-name products, including the offering of fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Domino's Pizza. The weakest section is the index, which seems to be missing subjects contained in the book, such as Wendy's. And readers may be confused by the fact that mineral and vitamin contents of foods in the brand-name section are given as percentages of the RDI (Reference Daily Intake, the information that appears on manufacturers' food labels), while in the other sections they are expressed in terms of an average serving.</p><p>This volume is the only good alternative to the nutrition standard <i>Bowes and Church's Food Values of Portions Commonly Used</i> (17th ed., Lippincott, 1998). Although similar in cost to<i> Bowes and Church's</i>, this new resource seems to be more consumer-friendly. Neither volume does a very complete job of giving nutritional data for restaurants, but this information can be found for 37 national chain restaurants in <i>Fast Food Facts </i>(5th ed., IDC Pub., 1998).</p><p>Overall, <i>The Wellness Nutrition Counter</i> is recommended for most libraries. As consumers become more health conscious, books of this type will become even more popular. The price is right for all libraries. A good popular selection. <i></i></p></p><h2>God of Mercy: AElfric&#39;s Sermons and Theology</h2><p>&#39;God of Mercy&#39; introduces and contains seventeen classic Old English sermons by the tenth-century Benedictine monk, AElfric, translated for the first time into Modern English. &#39;God of Mercy&#39; presents the theologically and spiritually attractive work of this important ealry monk.AElfric&#39;s timeless writing style is as attractive and unfettered as his message - God is a God of unending, mysterious mercy - and the Modern English translations reproduce that simplicity here. At the heart of this book is the Rule of St. Benedict, around which this tenth-century monk ordered his spiritual and earthly existence. A command from his prologue could serve as AElfic&#39;s mission statement: &#34;Listen carefully, my son, to the master&#39;s instructions, and attend to them with the ear of your heart...(A)nd...we will run on the path of God&#39;s commandments, our hearts overflowing with the ineffable delight of love.&#34; AElfric lived much of his life during a time of Viking terrorism, but - first in the village of Cerne Abbas, and later as abbot of the Benedictine community near Oxford, in the village of Eynsham - this dedicated monk doggedly put stylus to vellum in an attempt to educate and save others (and his own soul) through the good news of the gospel.</p><p>CARMEN ACEVEDO BUTCHER, PhD, is a Lecturer in the College Writing Programs at the University of California, Berkeley.

Whereas the historical-critical approach was concerned with the moment of a text&#39;s production (authorship, date, place of writing etc), the literary approach is concerned with the moment of the text&#39;s reception. Eryl W. Davies shows how and why approaches such as &#39;reader-response criticism&#39;, &#39;feminist criticism&#39;, &#39;ideological criticism&#39;, &#39;canonical criticism&#39; and &#39;post-colonial criticism&#39; are now becoming more popular in many quarters. The volume explains to the uninitiated in a readable and accessible form how strategies originally derived from secular literary criticism have been adopted by biblical scholars in order to understand the text of Scripture and to appreciate its relevance.</p><p>A clear guide to modern biblical criticism<p>Dr Eryl W Davies is a Reader in the School of Theology and Religious Studies at Bangor University.

When it first appeared in 1920, Mises was alone in challenging the socialists to explain how their pricing system would actually work in practice. <p>Mises proved that socialism could not work because it could not distinguish more or less valuable uses of social resources, and predicted the system would end in chaos. The result of his proof was the two-decade-long "socialist calculation" debate. This new edition contains an afterword by Joseph Salerno, who applies the calculation argument to contemporary problems like environmentalism and business regulation.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Mind Your Own Business, Kristy!

"I think all writing constitutes an effort to establish our own meaningfulness, even in the midst of sadness and disappointment." <p>In <b>Living to Tell the Tale</b>, McDonnell draws on this impulse, as well as on her own experiences as a writer and teacher of memoir, to give us what should become the definitive book on writing "crisis memoirs" and other kinds of personal narrative. She provides specific techniques and advice to help the writer discover his or her inner voice, recognize&#x2014;and then silence&#x2014;the inner censor, begin a narrative, and develop it with such aids as photographs and documents. </p><p>Citing many landmark works such as Maxine Hong Kingston's <b>The Woman Warrior</b> and Frank McCourt's <b>Angela's Ashes</b>, as well as unpublished writings, McDonnell shows how writers can recreate past experiences through memories, and imaginatively reshape material into the story that needs to be told. Each chapter concludes with exercises to help the writer grapple with particular problems, such as trying to write about experiences that are only partly recalled. </p><p>McDonnell also offers a list of recommended reading. <br><br>� Memoirs, such as Mary Karr's <b>The Liars' Club</b> (Penguin) have hit bestseller lists nationwide during the past year, and are of great interest to aspiring writers.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><b>Jane Taylor McDonnell</b> teaches a writing and reading course on memoir at Carleton College and has also taught at The Loft in Minneapolis.

Wallender&#39;s personal life can occasionally seem more depressing than even a provincial Swedish detective should be asked to bear, but his investigative skills are strictly first rate. And Mankell&#39;s story of the brutal murder of an elderly farm couple uncovers an unusual aspect of life in modern Sweden--a streak of fear and prejudice against the many newcomers from Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe who have sought asylum there.First in the Kurt Wallander series. <br>It was a senselessly violent crime: on a cold night in a remote Swedish farmhouse an elderly farmer is bludgeoned to death, and his wife is left to die with a noose around her neck. And as if this didn't present enough problems for the Ystad police Inspector Kurt Wallander, the dying woman's last word is "foreign, leaving the police the one tangible clue they have-and in the process, the match that could inflame Sweden's already smoldering anti-immigrant sentiments. <br>Unlike the situation with his ex-wife, his estranged daughter, or the beautiful but married young prosecuter who has peaked his interest, in this case, Wallander finds a problem he can handle. He quickly becomes obsessed with solving the crime before the already tense situation explodes, but soon comes to realize that it will require all his reserves of energy and dedication to solve.</p><h2>Plausible Prejudices: Essays on American Writing</h2><p>In this collection of essays, the author of &#34;The Middle of My Tether&#34; considers the various influences upon writing in the recent past that have systematically lessened its glory</p><p></p><h2>Samuel Morris</h2><p>Only God can perform miracles, and only a miracle can save the slave-prince Kaboo, and in doing so, change the lives of people around the world.</p><p></p><h2>Haiku, Vol. 1: Eastern Culture</h2><p>One of the first and still the best and most comprehensive introduction to haiku in any language other than Japanese.</p><p></p><h2>Second Time Around</h2><p>Original owner.

Structured as a daybook of sorts, the book follows the Cursing Mommy&#x2015;beleaguered wife of Larry and mother of two boys, twelve and eight&#x2015;as she tries (more or less) valiantly to offer tips on how to do various tasks around the home, only to end up on the ground, cursing, surrounded by broken glass. Her voice is somewhere between Phyllis Diller's and Sylvia Plath's: a hilariously desperate housewife with a taste for swearing and large glasses of red wine, who speaks to the frustrations of everyday life. <br>Frazier has demonstrated an astonishing ability to operate with ease in a variety of registers: from <i>On the Rez</i>, an investigation into the lives of modern day Oglala Sioux written with a mix of humor, compassion, and imagination, to <i>Dating Your Mom</i>, a sidesplitting collection of humorous essays that imagines, among other things, how and why you might begin a romance with your mother. Here, Frazier tackles another genre with his usual grace and aplomb, as well as an extra helping of his trademark wicked wit. The Cursing Mommy's failures and weaknesses are our own&#x2015;and Frazier gives them a loving, satirical spin that is uniquely his own.</p></p><p><b>Ian Frazier</b> is the author of <i>Great Plains</i>, <i>The Fish's Eye</i>, <i>On the Rez</i>, <i>Family</i>, and <i>Travels in Siberia</i>, as well as <i>Coyote v. Acme</i>, <i>Dating Your Mom</i>, and <i>Lamentations of the Father</i>, all published by FSG. A frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>, he lives in Montclair, New Jersey.<b>JANUARY</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>TUESDAY, JANUARY 4<br>And so, we set out. Ideally, this daybook would have started on Saturday morning, January 1, but Larry and I had to be in Encino. A client of Larry&#x2019;s invites the whole office out there to stay over in his gigantic house for New Year&#x2019;s Eve and New Year&#x2019;s Day every year. This client brings in a huge amount of business and Larry says we might be sleeping in the car if it weren&#x2019;t for him, so of course we have to go. And I do mean <i>we</i>, because the client is a big believer in wives attending, though they don&#x2019;t have much to do. Husbands, on the other hand, the client isn&#x2019;t so crazy about. That&#x2019;s another story.<br>As a result, we weren&#x2019;t here for New Year&#x2019;s Day. We flew back on the second, and on the third I drove to the assisted living to see my fucking father.<br>TUESDAY, JANUARY 4<br>I feel that I must start this day, month, and year over again. Just thinking about that weekend and then the trip to the goddamn horrible assisted living makes me want to put that nonsense far, far behind. I will clear my head, get a refill on my coffee, and go back to the kitchen table where I began.<br>We must always remember to be grateful for what we have. On this winter morning, with the temperature in the twenties and snow covering the ground outside, I am grateful just to be sitting here sheltered and indoors. My eight-year-old, Kyle, breaks out in hives and faints if you look at him cross-eyed, and he&#x2019;s probably doing exactly that right now in gym class, and any minute the phone will ring and it will be the snotty assistant principal, and I will have to go out and hope the car will start so I can pick up my swooning son. But that hasn&#x2019;t happened yet. Who was it who called worry &#x201c;negative prayer&#x201d;? I will keep my hopes and prayers positive on this first day (fourth, technically, as I already explained) of our journey year.<br>The children had such fun in the snow yesterday. I was at the fucking assisted living, Larry was down in the basement doing something or other with his boxes of capacitors, and the kids had an absolute ball outside, he said. God knows he probably wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention. From where I sit in my favorite kitchen chair I can see the snowman they made. I am grateful for my children&#x2019;s happiness and the small monument to it remaining on our front lawn.<br>Actually, as I look more closely at it, it&#x2019;s not so small. Moving to the front window I wonder how they ever built a snowman that high! In fact, it doesn&#x2019;t really resemble a snowman&nbsp;... <br>The reason it does not resemble a snowman, I now see, is that it is not a snowman, it is a snow penis. A giant snow penis on my front lawn. How could I not have noticed it before? I got back from the fucking assisted living after dark, that&#x2019;s why. They did quite an inventive job of it, with large snow testicles, as well. This must have been Trevor&#x2019;s idea. He is going on twelve, going on whatever age you can be sent to prison. He got poor Kyle to go along.<br>Those of you who keep up with my regular Cursing Mommy columns know that at some point in almost every one of them&#x2014;okay, every one of them&#x2014;the Cursing Mommy regrettably becomes frustrated with some aspect of daily life, and she flips out, screams curses, breaks things, gives people the finger, etc. Today, on the first or fourth day of our journey year, the Cursing Mommy is not going to do any of that. Serenity is the new watchword. I am now simply going to pull on Larry&#x2019;s boots, put my coat on over my bathrobe, go out in the front yard, and knock the revolting snow penis down.<br>Now I am in the yard and I smack the snow penis&#x2014;why did I forget my mittens?&#x2014;and <i>ouch</i>! Shit! The thing is solid ice! It has frozen solid overnight, I see. So I am giving the snow penis a good swift kick and GODDAMN FUCKING STUPID SNOW PENIS! FUCKING GODDAMN THING IS LIKE&#x2014;<i>OUCH!!</i>&#x2014;FUCKING CEMENT! I&#x2019;LL KICK YOU DOWN IF IT&#x2019;S THE FUCKING LAST THING&nbsp;... AHHH! SHIT! I SLIPPED ON THIS FUCKING SLIPPERY ICE AND I&#x2019;VE FALLEN IN THE SNOW!! LYING IN MY FUCKING FRONT YARD IN MY FUCKING BATHROBE! FUCKING GODDAMN LARRY! FUCK GEORGE BUSH! FUCKING GODDAMN JOHN BOEHNER, THAT FUCKING ASSHOLE!!... <br>[<i>pause</i>]<br>In just a minute I will get up and go inside. Let fucking Larry knock the fucking thing down when he gets home. It will melt eventually anyway.<br>Oh, what a fucking horrible day this is going to be.<br>WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 5<br>&#x201c;Open thou my lips, oh Lord, that my mouth may show forth thy praise.&#x201d;<br>Do we always remember to praise? I&#x2019;m not talking about praising our spouse or our kids or our coworkers, the &#x201c;self-esteem routine,&#x201d; though of course that&#x2019;s important, too. I mean praising the power or powers that placed us and everything around us upon this spinning cinder we call our earth&#x2014;yes, I mean exalting generally the simple beauty of the world. We should devote ourselves to this every instant from the moment we awake. First thing when we open our eyes in the morning we must say, &#x201c;Open thou our lips, that our mouths may show forth thy praise!&#x201d;<br>I wish I could always be conscientious about that, but sometimes, unfortunately, I am not. For example, this morning Larry was up, sitting on the edge of the bed and putting salve on his toe fungus, and I woke and looked at the ceiling and sighed, and I forgot to praise. Instead, I said, &#x201c;Shit.&#x201d;<br>Of course, I am the Cursing Mommy.<br>THURSDAY, JANUARY 6<br>Hello again, my friends, on another dark winter&#x2019;s morning. My, it is cozy here in the kitchen&#x2014;and out on the patio, and even in the yard, for that matter, where according to our outdoor thermometer the temperature is a shirtsleeve sixty-eight degrees. Thank goodness the &#x201c;snow sculpture&#x201d; is no more. Yesterday&#x2019;s torrential rains that also filled part of the basement washed most of it away. Often all we must do in life is wait, and our wishes will be fulfilled.<br>This morning I am counting my blessings. That goddamn snow penis is gone. Water got in some of the boxes of Larry&#x2019;s capacitors down in the basement, apparently. I suppose that&#x2019;s not a blessing, technically, but what the hell.<br>Do you sometimes have your first cocktail at 8:15 a.m.?<br>SATURDAY, JANUARY 8<br>I meant to write an entry for yesterday, but Kyle stayed home from school. All of Christmas vacation the kid is a picture of health, and then when classes start again, suddenly he feels poorly. The awful assistant principal did, in fact, call. I couldn&#x2019;t find my cell phone, which I spend my life looking for, and all at once there&#x2019;s this muffled ring and the cat goes shooting about five feet in the air. He&#x2019;d been sleeping on it. Molkowski, assistant principal, on the line.<br>Kyle was in a swoon again in gym, no surprise. Molkowski gave me the usual blah-blah-blah and I went and got him. I kept him indoors all of yesterday, but I made him go back this morning. His school now has some goddamn mandatory fucking Clean the Boiler Room Day every Saturday, because they repealed the school levy. Parents are supposed to help, too. I went along and took some rags, and Kyle and I made a morning of it. He managed not to faint from the horror of it all, poor guy.<br>MONDAY, JANUARY 10<br>One old tradition I absolutely adore is that of devoting every Monday to the family&#x2019;s weekly baking. Bright and early every Monday, my gramma Pat used to get up, pack a lunch for Grampa Hub, give him his bicarb, and shoo him out the door. Then she would light a Chesterfield and start to bake.<br>And I do mean <i>bake</i>! Gracious, what that woman couldn&#x2019;t do. Gramma Pat is long dead of emphysema, but I can still smell the delicious and enticing aroma of her kitchen, mixed with secondhand smoke, as I used to hang on her apron strings and watch her every gesture. Pies, cakes, fruit crumbles, strudels, lebkuchen dusted with powdered sugar and the odd bit of cigarette ash&#x2014;all appeared effortlessly, as if by magic. She never used a lighter. While she rolled dough with her left hand, she could fold a match from a matchbook and light it with her right! She also did all the family&#x2019;s bread baking&#x2014;white and brown bread, both&#x2014;and would never think of buying store-bought.<br>Can you excuse me for a second? It&#x2019;s the goddamn phone.<br>TUESDAY, JANUARY 11<br>Sabrina from the fucking goddamn assisted living cheerfully ruined yesterday by calling just to let me know that &#x201c;Dad&#x201d; had assaulted another patient. I had to drop everything and go over there, natch. Enough said. Let us return to:<br>&#x201c;The Cursing Mommy&#x2019;s Baking Day (continued)&#x201d;<br>God, I hate my fucking father.<br>I&#x2019;m sorry, that was what the shrinks call an &#x201c;intrusive thought,&#x201d; and it has no place in the making of this pie. Excuse me.<br>Today, just because I thought it would be a hoot, I am following a tasty-sounding recipe for chocolate pie that I found printed on a pie pan I bought yesterday at Food Superior. I get a lot of my best recipes from just such unexpected places. I have already melted the semisweet chocolate in the microwave, as instructed, and added a cup of strong coffee, and then combined these with the instant chocolate pie filling, for an extra chocolaty flavor. I then crushed the gingersnaps for the crust, and they are on this wax paper here.<br>I now spread the crushed gingersnaps evenly in the pie pan. After this step, I carefully pour in the filling mixture. Do I now add the extra cookie pieces to the top, or do I do that after baking? And to what temperature do I preheat the oven? And how long do I bake the pie? I will consult the recipe.<br>And now I see there is a problem. The recipe is on the bottom of the pie pan. Which I have just covered with gingersnap crust and a two-inch-deep layer of chocolate filling.<br>Oh, fuck everything.<br>I fucking give up.

Such intuitions are Reuven Tsur&#x2019;s point of departure in this investigation into the expressive effect of sound patterns, addressing questions of great concern for literary theorists and critics as well as for linguists and psychologists.<br>Research in recent decades has established two distinct types of aural perception: a nonspeech mode, in which the acoustic signals are received in the manner of musical sounds or natural noises; and a speech mode, in which acoustic signals are excluded from awareness and only an abstract phonetic category is perceived. Here, Tsur proposes a third type of speech perception, a poetic mode in which some part of the acoustic signal becomes accessible, however faintly, to consciousness.<br>Using Roman Jakobson&#x2019;s model of childhood acquisition of the phonological system, Tsur shows how the nonreferential babbling sounds made by infants form a basis for aesthetic valuation of language. He tests the intersubjective and intercultural validity of various spatial and tactile metaphors for certain sounds. Illustrating his insights with reference to particular literary texts, Tsur considers the relative merits of cognitive and psychoanalytic approaches to the emotional symbolism of speech sounds.</p><p>Poets, academics, and those who simply speak a language are subject to mysterious intuitions about the perceptual qualities and emotional symbolism of the sounds of speech.

Bockris ( With William Burroughs ), who worked with Warhol from 1977 to 1981 on Interview magazine and other projects, provides a detailed and absorbing interpretation of the Warhol enigma based on interviews with family, friends and associates. Pittsburgh-born Andek Warhola is revealed as very much a creature of his mother's suffocatingly provincial upbringing; her naive old-world exterior hid a cunning and manipulative personality that shaped her son's character, according to the author. Relating how Warhol transcended his background to reach pop superstardom, Bockris describes the development of the Warhol esthetic and the shrewd business maneuvers that built his fortune. Most controversial is discussion of Warhol's personal relationships: by Bockris's lights, "voyeur-sadist" Warhol exercised extreme passivity and detachment to control people, subjugating and then spurning many, especially his gay lovers.

The Russians, who had occupied the country throughout the 1980s, were long gone. The disparate ethnic and religious leaders who had united to eject the invaders - the famous mujaheddin - were at each others&#39; throats. For the rural poor of Kandahar province, life was almost impossible. On 12 October 1994 a small group of religious students decided to take matters into their own hands. Led by an illiterate village mullah with one eye, some 200 of them surrounded and took Spin Boldak, a trucking stop on the border with Pakistan. From this short and unremarkable border skirmish, a legend was born. The students&#39; numbers swelled as news of their triumph spread. The Taliban, as they now called themselves - taliban is the plural of talib, literally &#39;one who seeks knowledge&#39; - had a simple mission statement: the disarmament of the population, and the establishment of a theocracy based on Sharia law.

The Magdalena Alpine (<i>Erebia magdalena</i>) and all the other animals and plants mentioned in these pages are real species, and I have endeavored to depict them as accurately as I can. The insect order Grylloblattodea (glacier crawlers) has been shifted south of the Red Desert biogeographical barrier in southern Wyoming, but it does co-occur with <i>Erebia magdalena</i> in Alberta. The particular butterfly I've named Erebia is an imaginary individual of this species, but nothing in his experience should be other than plausible,given what we know of his kind. The Theano Alpine's name has been changed to <i>Erebia pawloskii</i> in North America, but I've used the old name <i>E. theano</i> as it is what October Carson would have known. Certain other places and landforms are based on actual locations, but their names have been changed if I have made up much about them.</p> <p>When historical figures appear under their own names, such as Evelyn Hutchinson, F. M. Brown, Enos Mills, and Vladimir Nabokov, I have tried to be true to them and their actual activities in the book's arena of action. Most players are either wholly <i>de novo</i> characters (including Prof. Griffin and Attalus) or composites loosely based on real people. Their names are different and I have felt no compulsion to treat their models accurately, only kindly.</p> <p>Vladimir Nabokov's connections to the place and the butterfly and to a couple of the characters (or their inspirations) are absolutely truthful; only a detail or two have been adumbrated by way of fill-in flash. However, I was unaware of Nabokov's personal attachment to the vicinity of Magdalena Mountain, and of his poem-within-a-novel about <i>Erebia magdalena</i>, during all the earlier drafts of the book: I discovered these parallel details only while co-editing and annotating <i>Nabokov's Butterflies: Unpublished and uncollected writings</i> (Beacon Press, 2000) with Brian Boyd and Dmitri Nabokov: a truly stunning case of convergent evolution.</p><br><br> <b>BEFORE</b><br><br> <p>Should a landing craft from elsewhere settle onto Magdalena Mountain on an early autumn morning, the visitors might arrive at two conclusions. First, this world is a golden one; the denizens must have monochromatic vision. Second, this world is harsh; the citizens must be tough. Upon leaving, they would jot field notes like "inhospitable, but rather pretty in a raw sort of way" in their intergalactic log.</p> <p>On both counts they would be partly right. The rockslide and its environs indeed glitter in September's dawn. On the fellfield, all the prostrate herbage has yellowed, except for certain low shrubs that have turned red, and they only lend depth to the overall gold. Sliding up the ridges, the tongues of aspenwood range, in their clones, from cinnamon to lemon, with orange-peel and persimmon in between. Even the granite, the substance of the scene, shines with a varied patina in the rising sun and morning frost, mica catching the sun's color, feldspar pink going to peach, gray feldspar to platinum.</p> <p>So, golden. And rough. But not necessarily inhospitable. True enough, humanity seldom appears on the scene. But there are lives below the surface, many of them. Now, in the chilly gilt of oncoming autumn, they come out of the rocks to bask. They suck every calorie of warmth from the cool fire of the alpenglow. For soon enough, afternoon cloud will rise, promising something rougher yet: rocks in winter. For now, frost holds off. Then the sun passes beyond its perigee, and all the gold is gone. Most of the animals retreat beneath the stones, as a minute caterpillar creeps down deep into a withered tussock of grass.</p><br><br> <b>PART ONE</b><br> Chapter One<br><br> <p>The yellow Karmann Ghia left the road at forty-five. Its tires never scored the soft tissue of the tundra. It simply flew over the edge, into the mountain abyss.</p> <p>A lookout marmot shrilled at the sight. A pair of pikas, young of the year, disappeared beneath their rockpile as the strange object passed overhead. Clearing the stony incline, the doomed auto glided over the rich mountain turf. Its shadow fell across a patch of alpine forget-me-nots, deepening their hue from sky to delft; then passed over a pink clump of moss campion. A black butterfly nectaring on the campion twitched at the momentary shading. Such a shift of light often signaled a coming storm, sending the alpine insects into hiding among the sod or stones. But this cloud passed quickly, so the sipping butterfly hunkered only briefly, then resumed its suck from the sweet-filled floret. A bigger black form took flight when the bright intruder entered its territory. The raven charged the big yellow bird to chase the interloper out of its airspace, succeeded, and resettled.</p> <p>As the slope fell away toward the canyon below, more than keeping pace with the glide path of the Ghia, so fell the yellow missile. Sky whooshed aside to make room for it, otherwise there was no sound but for three shrieks on the alpine air: a nutcracker's alarm scream; the whine of the engine, gunned by the foot glued to the Ghia's floorboard; and a third, muffled by the glass, growing into a hopeless wail.</p> <p>The thin alpine air parted before the plummeting car, smelling of green musk, of the great high lawn that is the Colorado mountain tundra. The perfumes of a hundred alpine wildflowers filled the grille of the Ghia. Soon the sweet mingled scents would be overcome by the rank fumes of oil and gasoline mixing with the terpenes of torn evergreens, as the grille split against pine and stone. But the rider smelled nothing.</p> <p>The air took on a chill as the projectile left the sunny upper reaches, crossed over timberline, and entered the shade of the upper forest. Never once had it touched down since takeoff, nor could it fly much farther. Gravity never ran out, but the earth rushed up at last to meet it. All the elements of the alpine earth&#x2015;mineral soil, bare stone, grass, sedge, herb, shrub, and solid trunk of ancient limber pine&#x2015;mingled with the yellow metal when the Ghia went to ground. Soft parts met hard. Granite tore rubber. Branches smashed glass and pierced the cloth upholstery. The engine block escaped its mounts and flew a little farther before shattering against a boulder and coming to rest as shiny shrapnel in the streambed far below. The blow that tore the motor free, ending its long scream, ripped the driver's door from its hinges. That other shriek was loosed into the general clamor. Then nothing.</p> <p>Almost nothing remained from this unplanned event to disturb the day up above, where it began. The nutcracker returned to its snag, the marmot to its post, the raven to its rock. The black butterfly nectared on, then flew. The forget-me-nots still flowered low against the ground. Not even the green verge of the road betrayed anything amiss. Only a black rubber streak in the roadway gave away the launching spot. Even the golden-mantled ground squirrel whose mad dash across the asphalt had started it all lay not dead on the shoulder, but basking on a boulder nearby in the late summer sun, unabashed by her close call.</p> <p>Of the steaming yellow mass among the trees and rocks a thousand feet below, no one knew a thing. Bumblebees investigating the yellow spatter on the slope found battered, barren steel instead of woolly sunflowers. The Karmann Ghia's aberrant track would never be repeated. And for all the difference it made to the mountain, it might never have happened at all.</p></p><h2>Game Of Crowns (Thorndike Press Large Print Biographies &amp; Memoirs Series)</h2><p>&#34;The #1 New York Times bestselling author of William and Kate and The Day Diana Died takes a compulsively readable look into the relationships and rivalries of Queen Elizabeth, Camilla Parker Bowles, and Kate Middleton.

It is not unusual for chamberlains and chambermaids, ushers and footmen and ministers of state alike to scurry when summoned to attend to their sovereign.<br> <br>Not Paul Whybrew&#x2014;the man Her Majesty simply calls &#x201c;Big Paul.&#x201d; In all his many years as Page of the Backstairs and Sergeant-at-Arms to the Queen, the preternaturally calm Whybrew&#x2014;at six feet four inches he towers over his five-foot-three-inch boss&#x2014;has never appeared rushed or flustered, even in times of crisis. No one appreciates Big Paul&#x2019;s typically British stiff-upper-lip attitude more than Elizabeth II, who has made Whybrew one of her closest friends and confidants. So comfortable is their personal relationship that Whybrew and the Queen often spend cozy evenings watching television together in Her Majesty&#x2019;s sitting room.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t difficult to see why the Queen might gravitate to someone like Big Paul. With his high forehead, close-set eyes, thinning hair, aquiline nose, and haughty aristocratic bearing, Whybrew could be Prince Philip&#x2019;s younger brother. In the famous 2012 London Summer Olympics video, it is Big Paul who introduces James Bond actor Daniel Craig to the Queen before they are depicted parachuting into the opening ceremonies together.<br> <br>As he approaches the Queen&#x2019;s bedroom on this particular morning, the only other person who can claim to be equally close to Her Majesty stands in the doorway, ashen-faced and trembling. Starting more than a quarter-century ago as Her Majesty&#x2019;s personal dresser, Angela Kelly worked her way up to the vaunted station of &#x201c;Personal Assistant, Advisor, and Curator to the Queen.&#x201d; In the process, the thrice-divorced Kelly, whose decidedly lowbrow Liverpool accent betrays her upbringing as a dock worker&#x2019;s daughter, has so endeared herself to the monarch that she is consulted about everything from affairs of state to baby clothes. (Among other assignments, Kelly supervised the team of British and Italian seamstresses who made the baptismal gowns for the Queen&#x2019;s great-grandchildren Prince George and Princess Charlotte.) During long weekends at Windsor, where Whybrew and Kelly have been given &#x201c;grace-and-favor&#x201d; apartments of their own on castle grounds, the Queen invariably indulges her passion for backstairs gossip over tea with the woman she simply calls &#x201c;Angela.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kelly, eyes welling with tears, shakes her head as Big Paul approaches. He takes his first tentative steps into the room. Fittingly, the plaintive wail of a bagpipe wafts up from the courtyard below. Each morning at nine the Queen&#x2019;s Piper, David Rodgers of the Irish Guards, stands outside the palace in full Royal Stewart tartan regalia and plays from a list of the monarch&#x2019;s favorite tunes. Wearing the two feathers in his cap that distinguish him from all other pipers in the realm, Rodgers is the fourteenth soldier (and first Irishman) to hold the post since Queen Victoria decreed that every monarch should start each day to the sound of Scottish bagpipes. Wherever she is in residence&#x2014;be it at Windsor, Sandringham, Balmoral, or Buckingham Palace&#x2014;this is how the Queen begins each day.<br> <br>But not this day. The heavy red velvet curtains that surround the royal bed have been drawn back to reveal a small, still figure. The Queen&#x2019;s personal physician rushes into the room, and within moments the shadowy figure of Sir Christopher Geidt materializes in the doorway. Burly, bald, suave, shrewd, and more than a little mysterious, Her Majesty&#x2019;s private secretary usually conceals his emotions behind a fixed, deceptively benign smile. Sir Christopher never tips his hand&#x2014;a skill honed during years spent with British intelligence before being tapped to serve as an aide to the Queen.<br> <br>At this moment, however, Geidt&#x2019;s defenses are down. Like those around him, he is wide-eyed with shock and&#x2014;despite the fact that this event had been anticipated and planned for decades&#x2014;utter disbelief. The first call he must make is to Clive Alderton, his counterpart at Clarence House, official residence of the Prince of Wales. Blond, boyish-faced Alderton, private secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, cannot conceal the emotion in his voice when he is told the news. Alderton must now maintain his composure as he prepares to make the single most important phone call of his life.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it, Charles?&#x201d; Camilla pulls back the draperies that encircle her husband&#x2019;s massive, ornately carved Georgian canopy bed. Like her mother-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall has always preferred to sleep in a velvet and damask cocoon, closed off from the outside world. Unlike the Queen, who hadn&#x2019;t shared a bedroom with her late husband, Prince Philip, for more than a half-century&#x2014;in part because of Philip&#x2019;s habit of sleeping with the windows wide open no matter the weather&#x2014;Camilla and Charles make it uncomfortably clear to members of their inner circle that they still enjoy an active, even adventurous, sex life.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Mummy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>He does not have to go on. Camilla recognizes the look immediately. She has seen the dazed expression cross Charles&#x2019;s face only three times in all the years she has known him. The first time was in 1979, when the small fishing boat belonging to Charles&#x2019;s great uncle and surrogate father, Louis Mountbatten, was blown up by IRA assassins, killing Mountbatten and three others. Camilla saw that expression of boundless grief again when, in 2002, the Queen Mother died in her sleep at age 101. Charles had been on a ski holiday with William and Harry at Klosters in Switzerland when it happened, but when he flew back to London Camilla would recall that &#x201c;the look of great sadness was still there.&#x201d;<br> <br>And then there was August 31, 1997&#x2014;the day Princess Diana was killed in a Paris car crash. Charles was vacationing with the rest of the Royal Family at Balmoral Castle at the time, and Camilla was the first person he called with the terrible news. She could hear the anguish in the Prince&#x2019;s voice as he, along with everyone else on the planet, tried to process what had happened.<br> <br>Yet this moment&#x2014;as fraught with historical importance as it is with deep shock, confusion, and grief&#x2014;transcends all the others. It is the moment Charles has been both dreading and eagerly anticipating all his life&#x2014;the moment when he loses the most important person in his life and, at the same time, at long last steps out of the shadows and into the part he was born to play.<br> <br>At Anmer Hall in Norfolk, the Duchess of Cambridge is walking the family&#x2019;s black English cocker spaniel Lupo when the housekeeper, Sadie Rice, strides briskly toward her with a cellphone in her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Prince William,&#x201d; the housekeeper tells Kate, handing the phone to the Princess with one hand as she takes Lupo&#x2019;s leash with the other.<br> <br>The Duke of Cambridge is still in the middle of his shift piloting an Airbus H145 search-and-rescue helicopter for the East Anglian Air Ambulance, and Kate knows instantly that something must be terribly wrong; William has never interrupted his work to call her before. Moments earlier, the Prince was in the skies over Bedfordshire, transporting the victim of a motorcycle accident to Addenbrooke&#x2019;s Hospital when his private secretary, Miguel Head, was patched through to the cockpit. Once Head told William his beloved &#x201c;Granny&#x201d; had passed away in her sleep, he continued piloting his helicopter to the hospital without saying a word to his fellow crew members.<br> <br>Now William is flying back to his air ambulance home base at Cambridge Airport, and sharing the terrible news with Kate. There is silence on the other end&#x2014;all Kate can hear is the pulse of helicopter blades as William struggles to compose himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Granny,&#x201d; he manages to say. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>At Buckingham Palace, Geidt and the other &#x201c;Men in Gray,&#x201d; as Diana called them&#x2014;the shadowy, behind-the-scenes figures who have always actually run the monarchy&#x2014;have been carefully preparing for this inevitable event for decades. Only a handful of palace officials, along with their government counterparts at Whitehall, have been given access to details of the secret succession plan code-named &#x201c;London Bridge.&#x201d; More frequently referred to in palace corridors as simply &#x201c;The Bridge,&#x201d; this ostensibly referred to the funeral itself&#x2014;but also to the momentous yet precarious transition from one monarch to another.<br> <br>Once a year every year since the late 1970s, practice funeral processions for senior members of the Royal Family, such as Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and the Queen, have taken place in the streets of London under cover of darkness. Prince Philip, whose funeral plans were code-named &#x201c;Forth Bridge&#x201d; after the span over the Firth of Forth in Scotland, wanted only a private, military-style service at St. George&#x2019;s Chapel in Windsor Castle. Had Prince Charles predeceased his mother, his funeral plan, code-named &#x201c;Menai Bridge&#x201d; after the bridge that connects the island of Anglesey to the Welsh mainland, would have had all the pageantry of a royal funeral. But it would not have been a state funeral, for state funerals are reserved for the monarch. For her part, the Queen planned her own funeral down to the most minute detail&#x2014;from the guest list, flowers, readings, and musical selections to which regimental units would participate and the color of their uniforms.<br> <br>The media have long been preparing for this, as well. Every six months, they also practice announcing the death of the Queen. BBC anchors, remembering how newscaster Peter Sissons was upbraided for announcing the Queen Mother&#x2019;s death wearing a light gray suit and a red tie, now are careful to keep a dark change of clothes at the ready, just in case.<br> <br>Over the past two hours, the Palace has notified the Queen&#x2019;s children and grandchildren. Geidt also places a call to 10 Downing Street, where an ashen-faced Prime Minister, whose weekly t�te-�-t�te with the Queen had taken place less than twenty-three hours earlier, immediately summons his ministers for an emergency cabinet meeting.<br> <br>It is the cabinet&#x2019;s job to convene an Accession Council&#x2014;an assembly that includes privy council members, lords of the realm, high commissioners of Commonwealth countries and the Lord Mayor of the City of London&#x2014;to formally proclaim the new monarch. The formality is just that, since the new sovereign takes over the moment the old one has died. The Accession Council will also formalize the new monarch&#x2019;s name. As Charles Philip Arthur George, the Prince of Wales weighs several options, including being known as George VII or even King Arthur I. He has waited too long to make his own mark; as expected, he will go down in history as Charles III.<br> <br>&#x201c;Queen Elizabeth II is dead.&#x201d; Although the Palace has made use of social media to promote the image of the monarchy, it uses a more traditional medium&#x2014;television&#x2014;to break the news to the British public. Despite all the speculation, the planning and preparation&#x2014;or perhaps because of it&#x2014;this new reality is hard to accept. After all, fully 98 percent of the earth&#x2019;s population has only known a world with Queen Elizabeth in it.<br> <br>The London Stock Exchange suspends trading. Flags around the world are lowered to half-staff. British television launches round-the-clock coverage, with all stations halting their regular programming to carry BBC-1&#x2019;s live news feed. The BBC will not resume its normal broadcast schedule for days&#x2014;the network has already announced that all comedy programs will be barred from its airwaves until after the state funeral. In their place will be several prerecorded packages on the life and times of the woman whose life spanned more than eighteen prime ministers, eight popes, and sixteen U.S. presidents.<br> <br>For three days before her funeral, the Queen lies in state at the Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall. The magnificent Imperial State Crown sits atop the coffin, which is draped with the blue, red, and gold harp and lions of the Royal Standard. An arrangement of carnations, the Queen&#x2019;s favorite flower, also rests on the coffin, bearing a note with a single hand-lettered word: Mama.<br> <br>Hundreds of thousands of mourners, many of them openly weeping, file past as Charles, his brothers Prince Andrew and Prince Edward (who assumed the title of Duke of Edinburgh on Philip&#x2019;s death), and William and Harry all take turns standing guard by the Queen&#x2019;s coffin in full dress uniform&#x2014;what has come to be known as the Vigil of the Princes.<br> <br>The day of the funeral is declared a national day of mourning, and an estimated 2 million people flood the streets of London to witness it. Never in recorded history have so many world leaders appeared in one place to pay their respects to a head of state. They fill the front pews of Westminster Abbey&#x2014;where Elizabeth II is the first monarch to have a funeral since George II in 1760&#x2014;solemnly listening to the service being led by the Archbishop of Canterbury.<br> <br>After the service, the gun carriage on which the sovereign&#x2019;s casket rests is pulled not by horses, as would be the case for anything less than a state funeral, but by sailors of the Royal Navy&#x2014;a tradition that began when, during Queen Victoria&#x2019;s funeral, the horses bolted and sailors stepped in to pull the coffin along the processional route. Now, with the Queen&#x2019;s equerries flanking the casket and members of the Royal Family walking behind, sailors pull the caisson carrying Her Majesty&#x2019;s coffin from Westminster Abbey to Paddington Station for the trip aboard the Royal Train to Windsor Castle.<br> <br>Once at Windsor, Great Britain&#x2019;s longest-reigning monarch is interred at St. George&#x2019;s Chapel alongside her husband, Philip, her father, George VI, the Queen Mother, her sister Margaret, and nine other sovereigns, including Henry VIII, Charles I, George III, and the last king to bear her grandson&#x2019;s name&#x2014;William IV.<br> <br>Around the globe, an estimated 3.5 billion people are glued to hours of live coverage on television and the internet&#x2014;a record-smashing figure that far surpasses the 2.5 billion viewers of Diana&#x2019;s funeral in 1997 and the 3 billion people who watched William and Kate&#x2019;s historic royal wedding in 2011. As was the case with Diana, the mood this time is one of deeply felt grief mixed with shock and disbelief. It is as if the entire planet is suddenly awakening to the fact that modern history&#x2019;s most enduringly famous figure&#x2014;a player on the world&#x2019;s stage for five generations&#x2014;has vanished.<br> <br>There will be other, inevitably jarring changes to mark the dawn of a new era. At sporting events, British subjects will now sing &#x201c;God Save the King.&#x201d; The Royal Mint and the Bank of England, as well as the Royal Mail, gear up to place Charles III&#x2019;s likeness on all coins, paper currency, and stamps. Wherever the Queen&#x2019;s likenesses have been displayed throughout the Commonwealth&#x2014;from government offices and embassies to pubs, department stores, and souvenir shops&#x2014;there will hang a photograph of the new king.<br> <br>For Charles and Camilla, Elizabeth&#x2019;s death also means a change of address.

Some of the narrative's most probing and innovative retellings have appeared in print in the last 100 years in the region of South India. This collection brings together, for the first time, modern retellings translated from the four major South Indian languages and from genres as diverse as drama, short stories, poetry, and folk song. The selections focus on characters generally seen as stigmatized or marginalized, and on themes largely overlooked in previous scholarship. Editor Paula Richman demonstrates that twentieth-century authors have used retellings of the Ramayana to question caste and gender inequality in provocative ways. This engaging anthology includes translations of 22 primary texts along with interpretive essays that provide background and frameworks for understanding the stories.</p></p><p>&#34;This collection makes a unique contribution to scholarship on Indian literature. It is clearly organized around provocative themes that are not the usual focus of Ramayana studies, illuminating not only the &#39;text&#39; of the Ramayana, but aspects of South Indian history and culture as well.&#34; --Elaine Craddock, Southwestern University<p>Paula Richman is William H.

Synge, &#34;The Struggle for Sea Power&#34; focuses on the age of empire and world colonization. The histories of European colonies in America, Australia, South Africa, and India are related. Also covered are the Revolution in America, the French Revolution, and campaigns of Napoleon. The Story of the World series, by M. B. Synge, comprises a set of five volumes, written at a middle school reading level, that cover all major events in the history of Western Civilization, from earliest recorded history to the close of the nineteenth century. With fifty or so short chapters in each volume, the series links the great eras in time and place together by a chain of stories of individuals who played principal parts in the events related. While statesmen and military commanders figure heavily in the narrative, stories of explorers, scientists, artists, authors, and religious figures are also presented. The author writes in an engaging fashion, using dialog frequently to bring scenes to life. She juxtaposes events happening at the same time in different parts of the world in a style reminiscent of the books of Genevieve Foster. This series is an excellent introduction to world history for adult readers as well as for children.</p><p></p><h2>From Splendor to Revolution: The Romanov Women, 1847--1928</h2><p>This sweeping saga recreates the extraordinary opulence and violence of Tsarist Russia as the shadow of revolution fell over the land, and destroyed a way of life for these Imperial women The early 1850s until the late 1920s marked a turbulent and significant era for Russia. During that time the country underwent a massive transformation, taking it from days of grandeur under the tsars to the chaos of revolution and the beginnings of the Soviet Union. At the center of all this tumult were four women of the Romanov dynasty. Marie Alexandrovna and Olga Constantinovna were born into the family, Russian Grand Duchesses at birth. Marie Feodorovna and Marie Pavlovna married into the dynasty, the former born a Princess of Denmark, the latter a Duchess of the German duchy of Mecklendburg-Schwerin. In From Splendor to Revolution, we watch these pampered aristocratic women fight for their lives as the cataclysm of war engulfs them. In a matter</p><p><p>JULIA P. GELARDI is the author of <i>Born to Rule </i>and <i>In Triumph's Wake.</i> She is an independent historian, currently living in Minnesota with her husband and two daughters.</p>FROM SPLENDOR TO REVOLUTION (1: A SPLENDID IMPERIAL COURT) <p>Nothing as meaningful and sacred as the coronation of a Romanov tsar could take place anywhere but in the very heart of the Russian Empire. Even resplendent St. Petersburg, Peter the Great&#x2019;s creation and the most western city in the empire, was unworthy. Only historic Moscow, the most Russian of cities, would do. Since the days of old Muscovy hundreds of years before, sentiment about rulers had changed little in the heart and soul of the average Russian. &#x201c;Russians had been taught&#x201d; from their cradle &#x201c;to regard their ruler as an almost god-like creature. Their proverbs embodied this view: &#x2018;Only God and the tsar know,&#x2019; &#x2018;One sun shines in heaven and the Russian tsar on earth,&#x2019; &#x2018;Through God and the tsar, Russia is strong,&#x2019; &#x2018;It is very high up to God; it is a very long way to the tsar.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;1 Coronations in Moscow were &#x201c;intended to bring home to the minds&#x201d; of the emperor&#x2019;s &#x201c;subjects in the most vivid manner the Heaven-appointed nature of his functions and inheritance.&#x201d;2 Thus, in accordance with tradition and mindful of the sacredness of the occasion, the Empress Marie Feodorovna traveled to Moscow for the coronation of her husband, Emperor Alexander III. It was May 1883, two years after he had ascended the Russian throne.</p><p>Widespread excitement surrounded the emperor and empress&#x2019;s coronation. Hundreds of thousands of their subjects descended upon Moscow to celebrate the momentous event that spring day. Festivities officially began when Russia&#x2019;s &#x201c;little Father and little Mother&#x201d;&#x2014;the thirty-eight-year-old emperor and his thirty-five-year-old empress&#x2014;made their majestic state entry into the city. A journalist who witnessed the scene from the Kremlin ramparts observed the royal retinue in their carriages to have been of &#x201c;interminable length.&#x201d;3 Not just long, the procession was of incomparable majesty, a dazzling and awe-inspiring sight. An impressive array of royalty, nobility, dignitaries, and soldiers processed before packed crowds, producing a rarely seen panorama of splendor. Crowds continually gasped with admiration over such sights as the imposing chevalier-gardes with their silver cuirasses and white tunics, along with the Cossacks with their long red lances, looking &#x201c;perfectly wild and uncivilized.&#x201d; Especially arresting in appearance were the Asiatic deputations from the Russian Empire&#x2019;s far-flung provinces. These exotic representatives with their lyrical titles included the Khan of Khiva and the Emir of Bokhara who wore &#x201c;high fur caps&#x201d; and jewels flashing on their belts and headpieces.4 Even prancing horses made an indelible impression, thanks to their eye-catching harnesses embedded with glistening semiprecious stones.</p><p>Most spectacular of all was the imperial family. The colossal frame of the bearded Emperor Alexander III was impossible to miss. His subjects were awed to see him astride a white charger and dressed as a Russian general, his head topped by an Astrakhan cap. Following the emperor were his sons, the fifteen-year-old heir, the Tsarevich Nicholas, and twelve-year-old Grand Duke George. Riding next to Alexander III and enjoying a special place of honor was his brother-in-law, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the scarlet uniform of a British general. Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna, the emperor&#x2019;s only sister, accompanied her husband the duke, second son of England&#x2019;s venerable Queen Victoria.</p><p>When the Empress Marie Feodorovna appeared amidst the pealing of bells and the booming of cannons, the crowds reverently crossed themselves and greeted their empress with a thundering ovation. The emperor&#x2019;s petite, dark-haired consort made her way in a gold carriage, &#x201c;a veritable mass of glass and gilding&nbsp;... drawn by eight perfectly white horses in gold harness, each horse led by a groom in blue velvet and white plumed casques.&#x201d;5 With the empress sat her sister-in-law, thirty-one-year-old Queen Olga of Greece, and Marie Feodorovna&#x2019;s elder daughter, eight-year-old Grand Duchess Xenia, who, according to an eyewitness, looked &#x201c;astonished at the homage that was being paid to them.&#x201d;6 Following Marie Feodorovna&#x2019;s carriage were those of the Romanov grand duchesses, including Marie Feodorovna and Marie Alexandrovna&#x2019;s sister-in-law, twenty-nine-year-old Marie Pavlovna (&#x201c;Miechen&#x201d;), wife of the emperor&#x2019;s brother Grand Duke Vladimir. Like her imperial counterparts, Miechen dazzled the crowds in her white gown and glittering diamonds and pearls.</p><p>Spectacular as the procession was, there was a palpable, underlying tension, for the imperial family was under threat from Russian terrorists, known as the Nihilists. A number of the distinguished guests noted this anxious atmosphere, including Mrs. Frederic Chenevix Trench, wife of the military attach� to the British embassy in St. Petersburg. Mrs. Trench was impressed by the gorgeous pageantry of the coronation entry, but she was even more struck by Marie Feodorovna&#x2019;s brave face before her adoring subjects. &#x201c;On the very morning of the entry,&#x201d; recalled Trench, &#x201c;several anonymous letters had been received by both the Emperor and Empress telling them to prepare for the worst if they persisted in their intention of going in state to the Kremlin&nbsp;... Yet, there sat the Empress with a smile on her face, not knowing at what moment there might be a desperate attempt upon her own or upon the Emperor&#x2019;s life. Not only did the imperial couple receive such letters of warnings, but many of the attendants who were to form part of the pageant, and the little pages and postilions who accompanied the Empress&#x2019;s chariot, each received separate letters telling them that they would not reach the Kremlin alive.&#x201d;7 Mary King Waddington, wife of a French diplomat and guest of the emperor and empress, also noticed the &#x201c;highly charged atmosphere&#x201d; and surmised why the Empress Marie Feodorovna, behind the smiles and bows looked &#x201c;grave and very pale.&#x201d; Waddington concluded that &#x201c;it must have been an awful day for her, for she was so far behind the Emperor [in the procession], and such masses of troops in between, that he might have been assassinated easily, she knowing nothing of it.&#x201d;8</p><p>Despite these sinister threats, Alexander III and Marie Feodorovna, their entourage and the imperial family, including Marie Alexandrovna, the Duchess of Edinburgh; Queen Olga; and Miechen, survived their state entry and made their way unscathed to the Kremlin, the medieval walled citadel dominating the banks of the Moscow River. Mrs. Waddington thought the Kremlin with its &#x201c;great crenulated wall&nbsp;... quantities of squares, courts, churches, palaces, barracks, [and] terraces,&#x201d; along with its &#x201c;gilt domes, pink and green roofs, and steeples,&#x201d; presented a unique and splendid vision. The color &#x201c;pink predominated,&#x201d; she observed, most likely because of the &#x201c;rose flush of the sunset which gave a beautiful color to everything.&#x201d;9 For the following three days the emperor and empress remained secluded in the Kremlin on a religious retreat. In the meantime, &#x201c;more and more stringent measures,&#x201d; noted Mrs. Trench, were &#x201c;taken to prevent any un-authorised person from entering the walls of the Kremlin, for, as the all-important day of the coronation draws near, no amount of precaution seems too minute to counteract and prevent any possible machinations of the Nihilists.&#x201d;10</p><p>On the day of their coronation, the emperor and empress emerged. They &#x201c;walked under a splendid canopy held aloft on long golden staffs by sixteen generals, whilst sixteen other officers held the silken cords which steadied it. The Metropolitans of Novgorod, Moscow, and Kieff, who had prayed all night&nbsp;... came forth with their clergy to meet the imperial pair.&#x201d; Inside the Cathedral of the Assumption, &#x201c;the deacons swung their censers to and fro. Clouds of incense rose in the air and the censers danced in them like balls of molten gold. All around was a sea of eager and excited faces.&#x201d;11 Inside the cathedral, the brilliant gold and precious stones that adorned much of the interior dazzled observers. Vying for attention were exquisite frescoes and sparkling icons along with the gorgeously vested clergy. The coronation ceremony began with Queen Olga of Greece and the Tsarevich Nicholas leading the imperial procession into the cathedral. As Alexander III and Marie Feodorovna entered the cathedral, nearly all eyes were firmly fixed on them. &#x201c;I could see,&#x201d; recalled Mrs. Trench, &#x201c;that the poor Empress was very much agitated; her chest was heaving with emotion, and she was nearly as white as her silver dress.&#x201d;12 Mary Grace Thornton, daughter of the British ambassador to Russia, thought the Empress Marie Feodorovna had possessed &#x201c;a certain stateliness&#x201d; on her coronation day. &#x201c;She was very pale,&#x201d; recounted Thornton, &#x201c;but I thought that I had never seen her look more sympathetic.&#x201d;13</p><p>Emperor Alexander III first crowned himself. Marie Feodorovna then knelt humbly before her husband, whereupon Alexander lifted his crown from his head and placed it on hers momentarily. Afterward, he took Marie Feodorovna&#x2019;s own crown and held it in place on her head. Once the emperor crowned his wife empress, Marie Feodorovna unexpectedly embraced Alexander in a touching moment. Grand Duke Constantine (&#x201c;K.R.&#x201d;), Queen Olga&#x2019;s brother, was moved by the sight, confiding in his diary: &#x201c;I cannot describe, cannot express how touching and tender it was to see these embraces of husband and wife and kisses under the imperial crown&#x2014;this ordinary human love in the glitter and radiance of imperial majesty.&#x201d;14 The emperor and empress then took Holy Communion, signaling the end of the cere...</p></p><h2>One Hundred Years of Old Testament Interpretation</h2><p>Very Good, and approaching Near Fine.

When Paul loses his job, Carter offers him the chance to head the legal team at his hedge fund. Thrilled with his good fortune in the midst of the worst financial downturn since the Great Depression, Paul accepts the position.</p><p>But Paul's luck is about to shift: a tragic event catapults the Darling family into the media spotlight, a regulatory investigation, and a red-hot scandal with enormous implications for everyone involved. Suddenly, Paul must decide where his loyalties lie-will he save himself while betraying his wife and in-laws or protect the family business at all costs?</p><p>Cristina Alger's glittering debut novel interweaves the narratives of the Darling family, two eager SEC attorneys, and a team of journalists all racing to uncover-or cover up-the truth. With echoes of a fictional <i>Too Big to Fail</i> and the novels of Dominick Dunne, <i>The Darlings</i> offers an irresistible glimpse into the highest echelons of New York society-a world seldom seen by outsiders-and a fast-paced thriller of epic proportions.</p></p><p><b>Cristina Alger</b> received her B.A. from Harvard College and her J.D. from NYU Law School.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>James Boswell is for some the ideal scribe, for others a sycophantic toady. Edmund Wilson, for example, memorably labeled him "a vain and pushing diarist." Boswell can even be seen as someone unconsciously intent on undermining his idol in sonorous, balanced sentences. Early on in his massive <i>Life</i>, he puts all manner of ideas into our heads with his boobish attempts to clear the youthful Johnson of potential impropriety: "His juvenile attachments to the fair sex were, however, very transient; and it is certain that he formed no criminal connection whatsoever." And while it's often tempting to ignore Boswell's more personal intrusions and delight solely in the melancholic master's words and deeds, there are suchdelightful admissions as, "I was at this time so occupied, shall I call it? or so dissipated, by the amusements of London that our next meeting was not till Saturday, June 25..." <p> Samuel Johnson was born in 1709 and died in 1784--a long life, though one marred by depression and fear of death. On April 20, 1764, for example, he declared, "I would consent to have a limb amputated to recover my spirits." Many of the quotes Boswell includes are a sort of greatest hits: Johnson's definitions of oats and lexicographer, his love for his cat Hodge, as well as thousands of bon, and mal, mots. ("Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel"; "Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are surprized to find it done at all.") But there are also many unfamiliar pleasures--Boswell's accounts of Johnson's literary industry, including the <i>Dictionary,</i> <i>The Rambler</i>, and <i>Lives of the Poets</i>; Johnson's singular loathing for Scotland and France; and the surprising hints of revelry. Awakened at 3 AM by friends, he greets them with, "What, is it you, you dogs! I'll have a frisk with you." This at age 42. Johnson's final years were marked by pain and loneliness but certainly no loss of wit.</p>Scottish writer and biographer of the writer Samuel Johnson, Boswell is regarded as one of the world&#39;s greatest diarists. His journals are known for their dramatic and vibrant quality.</p><h2>Learning Islam Textbook: Level 1 (6th Grade)</h2><p>The "Learning Islam 1" is planned for students in sixth grade or equivalent setting.

Tennyson's brook is a living thing, hurrying down 30 hills, bickering across valleys, stealing by lawns and grassy plots, and making ``netted sunbeam dance against...sandy shallows.'' It is as rambunctious as the ``lusty trout'' it carries. But in this version, Tennyson's brook is so quaint and butterfly-ridden that we can barely even see it, let alone celebrate it. A bawdy and capricious flirt of a river, the one the poet claimed would ``go on forever'' while men came and went, has been tamed by a Hallmark Card hand. (Glossary) (Poetry/Picture book. 4- 7) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 3-5-Micucci's naturalistic watercolors illumine selections from Tennyson's much longer poem, "The Brook." The work deals with the passing of people over time and the replacing of generations. Micucci has sketched the same theme in his illustrations-a girl grows up, marries, and has children of her own while seasons and the stream continue their annual pattern. Each double-page spread sets events on the water's banks in a definite season based on a careful reading of the text; the insects and plants ("And many a fairy foreland set/ With willow-weed and mallow), the activities of the people, and the sort of light that happens in spring or fall are carefully depicted. Tennyson's poetic vision is well served in this lyrical book.<br><i>Kathleen Whalin, Greenwich Country Day School, CT</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Difficulty Of Being</h2><p>Writer, filmmaker, visual artist, and celebrated leader of the French avant-garde, Jean Cocteau (1889&#x2013;1963) once announced, "One must know how to go too far." The astounding scope of his work stands as a testament to that revolutionary spirit. Throughout his life he boldly experimented in almost every medium and achieved enduring success in them all: novels like <i>Les Enfants Terribles</i>; films such as <i>The Blood of a Poet</i>, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, and <i>Orphee</i>; as well as plays, ballets, drawings, poems, and even an opera of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> (written with Stravinsky). Cocteau regarded <i>The Difficulty of Being</i> as the key to his oeuvre and as a daring act of self-revelation. With terse skill he explores the innermost frontiers of his personality, from childhood memories to his creative wrestlings, from incisive portraits of Proust, Gide, Nijinsky, Picasso, and Stravinsky to reflections on death, friendship, dreams, youth, pain, beauty, haunted houses, and of course, on being without being. But no matter what he is writing about, he goes straight to the mark, illuminating a thought, subject, or personal reminiscence with precision and vitality. A magazine once asked Cocteau, If his house were burning and he could take only one thing, what would it be? "I'd take the fire," he answered. In <i>The Difficulty of Being</i> Cocteau does just that.</p><p><b>JEAN COCTEAU</b> (1889&#x2013;1963) was a novelist, poet, filmmaker, artist and playwright. Born in a village just outside of Paris, he left home at fifteen and published his first volume of poetry, <i>Aladdin&#x2019;s Lamp</i>, at nineteen. He circulated in the highest ranks of bohemian Paris, and counted Picasso and Proust among his close friends. His most famous works include the novel <i>Les Enfants terribles</i> and the films <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> and <i>Orpheus</i>. He was openly gay and at one time an opium addict. He died of a heart attack after being informed of the death of his friend, the singer Edith Piaf.<br><br><b>GEOFFREY O'BRIEN</b> is the Editor-in-Chief of the Library of America.

This book collects Rosenblum&#39;s 50 best essays from the last 40 years-most never before published in book form-to take readers on an exhilarating exploration of the meanings, movements, personalities, and paradoxes of American art of the 20th century. Whether examining &#34;My Life with Rothko&#34; or de Kooning&#39;s &#34;fatal women,&#34; Koons&#39; Made in Heaven or the Starn Twins&#39; Crucifixion, Rosenblum&#39;s essays are unfailingly provocative and illuminating. A rich selection of illustrations makes this a feast for everyone interested in modern art. 206 illustrations, 6 1/2 x 9 1/2&#34; Robert Rosenblum is a professor of fine arts at New York University, a curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and a contributing editor at ArtForum. His 14 previous books include such classics as Abrams&#39; Cubism and Twentieth-Century Art and, with H. W. Janson, 19th-Century Art. He lives in New York City.Starting out in the 1950s with Pop and Post-Painterly painting (Frank Stella, Jasper Johns) and ending up with big shots from the 1980s (Eric Fischl, Jeff Koons), these 50 essays revisit every stage of Rosenblum's long career as a critic and reviewer, offering an idiosyncratic tour of recent visual art. Rosenblum (Cubism and Twentieth-Century Art), a professor at NYU, Guggenheim curator and Artforum contributing editor explains that he aims "to translate the visceral experience of art into... modes of language and art history." Usually he succeeds, as his short pieces introduce and make particular cases for Rothko, Cy Twombly, Joe Brainard, Mike and Doug Starn, and others. (All but two of the essays have been published before; many began as reviews of exhibitions.) Equally comfortable with the retrograde, the canonical and the new, Rosenblum gravitates in particular to the ways in which painters consider the history of their form. For Rosenblum, Willem de Kooning's dangerous women revise Ingres' visions, and Andrew Wyeth's famous Christina's World stays true to a peculiarly American reverie. (Sculptors and installation artists make it in; most conceptual art does not.) More general topics addressed include the importance of retrospective and memory in American painting; the heroic ambitions of Abstract Expressionists; Giorgio de Chirico's "historic quotation" and its later equivalents in U.S. paintings; and the perennial question, "What Is American About American Art?" Though it's always clear what he means to say, Rosenblum's prose can be less than compelling. Yet despite some awkward sentences, he makes a convincing case for the painter Mark Innerst, whose "time capsules" neatly reimagine cities' space. 206 b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Foggy, Foggy Forest</h2><p><b>Peek through each foggy vellum page to guess what lies beyond in an innovative novelty book that's a surefire page turner.</b><br><br>"What can this be in the foggy, foggy forest?"

Readers may take a guess and turn the page to see if they&#x2019;re right &#x2014; the answering image appears in full color (often sporting a funny twist). A unicorn playing a horn?

He lives in Brighton, England.Below a silhouette imposed upon each plasticky and opaquely translucent page, this inventively designed picture book presents the question, What can this be in the foggy, foggy forest? Flipping the page reveals a color drawing on the other side of the darkened shapes: an elf sitting on a mushroom, a fairy queen jumping on a trampoline, Cinderella and Snow White romping about with water pistols. The neatest thing about the book is the cumulative effect of each almost-transparent page, through which you can see the vague outlines of the next several pages&#x2019; worth of silhouettes. The effect is a palpable sense of the fog lifting and moving gradually with each step into a fairy-tale forest. While there isn&#x2019;t much of a story line to connect the pictures throughout, and the big fair that concludes seems like an odd curveball at the end, kids will enjoy the guesswork involved in turning each page, as well as the fanciful, humorous takes on the familiar figures they&#x2019;ll find throughout.

Many books have been published about the '45, examining almost every aspect of the political and dynastic struggle which it represented, except the most important: the military campaign which decided the outcome of that struggle once and for all. Stuart Reid's rigorous new analysis of the Highland resistance to British rule&#x2014;drawing upon years of primary research and walking the actual battlefields&#x2014;provides for the first time a properly balanced account of the last military engagements to be fought on British soil.At the heart of this study is a penetrating examination of the two armies involved&#x2014;their strengths, weaknesses, and very different tactical doctrines. Weaving this thorough understanding of how those armies fought into previously neglected eyewitness accounts with a detailed examination of the ground on which the battles were fought, Stuart Reid presents an important new contribution to eighteenth century military history.</p><p><b>Stuart Reid</b> was born in Aberdeen in 1954.

Now Davis has teamed up with fellow midwife Carol Leonard to attend to all stages in a woman's life, by imagining and exploring 13 positive archetypes.

A thorough overview of the oils enables the reader to understand the artist&#39;s overriding creative ambitions, but it is in his works on paper that Schiele truly stands out. As evidenced by the numerous oversize and superbly printed reproductions in this book, Schiele deserves to be counted among the foremost draftsmen of all time, ranking alongside Albrecht Durer and Hans Holbein. Egon Schiele: 27 Masterworks follows the entire trajectory of the artist&#39;s career, beginning with his early Gustav Klimt-influenced paintings and his startling Expressionist breakthrough in 1910 at the tender age of 20, to his more serene late works, completed shortly before his untimely death at the age of 28.</p><p></p><h2>The Philadelphian</h2><p>Touted by its original publisher as an expos� and indictment of blue-blooded Philadelphia society, the late Richard Powell's The Philadelphian was released to rave reviews and later became the 1959 Oscar-nominated film, The Young Philadelphians, starring Paul Newman and Robert Vaughn. <p>The Philadelphian was an immediate national bestseller, and in the 50 years since its debut the novel has been widely hailed as Richard Powell's crowning literary achievement. The author's acute sense of irony infuses this raw, powerful saga of a family of humble origins climbing the Philadelphia social ladder. Beginning with the emigration of a poor Irish girl in 1857, the story spans four generations and climaxes with her grandson, an ambitious young defense lawyer, holding the city spellbound in one of the most compelling courtroom scenes ever written. </p><p>Plexus Publishing, Inc. is delighted to have worked with the author's family to restore The Philadelphian to print after a long and inexplicable hiatus. This 50th anniversary edition includes a new foreword by Oscar nominee Robert Vaughn and, in a special preface, Richard Powell's previously unpublished (and not-to-be-missed) soliloquy, "The Personality of Philadelphia." (Paperback)</p></p><p>A Seventh generation Philadelphian, Richard Powell (1908-1999) was a prodigiously talented writer whose 19 full-length fictional works included many mysteries along with several comedic, dramatic, and historical novels. Prior to retiring to Florida in 1958 to write full time, he studied history at Princeton, was a reporter for the Philadelphia Evening Ledger, served in the Army during WWII, and worked for many years in advertising and public relations. <p>Powell was an inventive storyteller and a keen observer of human foibles and follies who, at the peak of his writing prowess in the late 1950s and early 1960s, emerged as a master of the modern novel. No matter what fiction genre Powell turned his hand to, his wry characterizations, crackling dialog, and deft plotting made each book an irresistible page-turner. Several of his novels including The Philadelphian were made into feature films. </p><p>While most of Richard Powell's novels disappeared from publishers' lists during the 1970s, his work is currently experiencing a well-deserved revival, with at least three books in addition to The Philadelphian currently available in new editions or soon to be reprinted. More, it is to be hoped, will soon follow.</p></p><h2>The Early Morning Milk Train: The Cream of Emett Railway Drawings</h2><p>Hardback book with dust jacket titled THE EARLY MORNING MILK TRAIN by Roland Emett.</p><p></p><h2>The Bad Boy Billionaire&#39;s Wicked Arrangement</h2><p><p><em>The first installment of a sexy series about a modern-day heroine writing historical novels based on her romantic misadventures with the Bad Boy Billionaire.</em></p> <p>Jane Sparks has accidentally announced her engagement on Facebook&#x2014;to the infamous Bad Boy Billionaire, Duke Austen.

Although directed at those seeking to use the healing arts from a purely Pagan perspective, it will be useful to any who are interested in complementary therapies. Written with this in mind, The Healing Craft is both academic and practical, combining chapters on the necessary information required to be a healer (e.g. chapters on the physical and spiritual body) with several chapters designed to increase the reader&#39;s skills in several different healing techniques. All the chapters bring together both the orthodox medical viewpoint with that of the complementary therapist.Included within the book are chapters on Spiritual Healing, Massage and Aromatherapy, Shamanistic and Magical Practices, Counselling (with Tarot and Past Life Regression) plus a chapter on Last Rites. Obviously it is impossible to do justice to many of these subjects in a single chapter, so they have been written to!guide the reader to what they will need to learno heal others effectively, while offering basic practical skills.

It describes the lives and aspirations of the Prozorov family, the three sisters (Olga, Masha, and Irina) and their brother Andrei. They are a family dissatisfied and frustrated with their present existence. The sisters are refined and cultured young women who grew up in urban Moscow; however for the past eleven years they have been living in a provincial town. Moscow is a major symbolic element: the sisters are always dreaming of it and constantly express their desire to return. They identify Moscow with their happiness, and thus to them it represents the perfect life. However as the play develops Moscow never materializes and they all see their dreams recede further and further. Meaning never presents itself and they are forced to seek it out for themselves.</p><p>Anton Chekhov (1860 &#x2013; 1904) was a Russian playwright and master of the modern short story. He was a literary artist of laconic precision who probed below the surface of life, laying bare the secret motives of his characters. Chekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story. Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre.</p><h2>A Life of Kenneth Rexroth</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Linda Hamalian is to be saluted for the sheer amount of detection and unraveling she has brought to her life of Kenneth Rexroth. It&#x2019;s the kind of information everyone seems to take for granted, but which would still be covered by the desert sands of time except for the biographer&#x2019;s herculean labors.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Washington Post Book World</em></strong></p> A poet and activist, Kenneth Rexroth is a central figure in the San Francisco literary renaissance. But his nature and love poetry have left their mark on several generations of modern poets, from Beats to Denise Levertov, Carolyn Forch�, and Jessica Hagedorn. A complex person, Rexroth was a self-taught man of great knowledge, a consummate storyteller, a man who could be thoroughly charming one day and who could take your head off the next. In the definitive and only biography, Linda Hamalian explores Rexroth&#x2019;s life and work in all their depth.</p><p>A poet and activist, Kenneth Rexroth is a central figure in the San Francisco literary renaissance. But his nature and love poetry have left their mark on several generations of modern poets, from the Beats to Denise Levertov, Carolyn Forche, and Jessica Hagedorn. A complex person, Rexroth was a self-taught man of great knowledge, a consummate storyteller, a man who could be thoroughly charming one day and who could take your head off the next. In the definitive and only biography, Linda Hamalian explores Rexroth&#39;s life and work in all their depth.In this first full-length biography, richly detailed and thoroughly documented, the self-taught Rexroth emerges as a major American poet. Rexroth, a prominent figure in San Francisco's literary renaissance, was also a jazz-poet performer, translator, mentor, critic, leftist commentator, pacifist, Catholic-Buddhist spiritualist, world traveler, wit, and iconoclast. Hamalian depicts the virtues and flaws of this fascinating man with cool, even-handed balance. Married four times, and father to two daughters, he yearned to understand and fulfill the lives of the women close to him. Longing for stable relationships, he sometimes abused, exploited, and alienated others, then accused them of deserting him. He bowed to no authority, but his bravado often shielded hidden insecurities. He took great delight in nature's beauty, but in his poems life and art often diverged. With its multifaceted portrait, rendered with photographic accuracy, this instructive book augments our appreciation of the man and his era. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Addie Lee Bracy, Beaver Coll.

Okay, I'm Sam Dawkins, but everybody calls me Snikwad, or Snik, on account of that's my name spelled backward. It's a snikname. Get it? </p><p> Do we really have to go through this whole thing all over again? I mean, sometimes freak accidents just happen. There's nothing you can do about it. Nobody means for them to happen. They just do. It just did. We're all sorry it happened. If any of us had known what was going to happen, we never would have done any of it. Can I go home now? I really don't like being here. </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> I can't believe I'm sitting in this room again. I want you to know that this is just the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me in my entire life. I'm not a criminal! It was an accident. We're sorry. None of us knew it was going to get out of control, I swear! I have worked so hard all my life to get good grades and sign up for lots of extracurricular activities and go to church and always do the right thing. I have been on the Principal's List every marking period since second grade. I'm not talking about the honor roll, where you can get Bs on your report card. The Principal's List! That's straight As. And now this happens...again! It makes me question why I try so hard to be good. I mean, really, what's the reward? If this keeps me out of the Ivy League, my mom will never let me forget it. </p><p> <b>JUDY'S MOM</b><br> I assure you, my daughter will <i>never</i> be involved with anything like this again. Not if I have anything to say about it. I teach my children to learn from their mistakes. She is on permanent probation. </p><p> <b>KELSEY DONNELLY. GRADE 6</b><br> We are all really sorry. I'm not just saying that because we're in trouble. We really felt terrible about what happened. It was just one of those freak accidents. Do I really have to tell the whole story from the beginning? Okay. </p><p> I have to confess, it was kinda cool seeing my picture in the paper the first time and everything. Y'know? Even if it was because we got caught heaving the homework machine into the Grand Canyon. It was even mentioned on <i>The Today Show</i>! Can you believe that? We were a little famous for a while. We had our fifteen minutes. </p><p> I mean, don't get me wrong. I felt bad and all because what we did was wrong. But you can't help but get a little tingle when you see your picture in the paper. I cut it out and put it in my scrapbook. </p><p> But this...this is getting old. I promise you won't see me in here again. I promise. </p><p> <b>BRENTON DAMAGATCHI. GRADE 6</b><br> First let me say it was all my fault. The others were there, of course. But I built the machine in the first place. I have to take responsibility for anything that was done with it. </p><p> I wonder if it might be possible to invent a time machine. I have no desire to go to the past or future, personally. But if one had a time machine, anytime you made a mistake in life, you could just go back a few seconds and erase it. Just like the eraser on a pencil. Do it over. Then you would never make any mistakes. You would be perfect. Except, I suppose, for the mistakes you don't know about. You can't fix a mistake if you don't even know that you made one. </p><p> May I have a drink of water? Thanks. </p><p> <b>RONNIE TEOTWAWKI. GRADE 6</b><br> You wanna know what I thought about the whole thing? I'll be honest. I thought it was great that Brenton, Snik, Judy, and Kelsey got caught throwing their homework machine into the canyon. What a dumb thing to do! And people always say <i>I</i> use bad judgment! It served 'em right. That's how I felt. I laughed all day. </p><p> Of course, this is a different story. I was involved. I admit it. If you need to throw me in reform school or something, well, I guess I deserve it. </p><p> <b>MISS RASMUSSEN. FIFTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> They are all good kids. They really are. I felt partly responsible for the first mess because it happened on my watch. I was a first-year teacher at the time. If I had been more experienced, I probably would have noticed that their homework was so similar. I might have figured out that they were using a machine to do it for them. Ah, but you live and learn, right? </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> You want to go all the way back to September? Okay. Well, that's my favorite time of year because the tourists have gone home. The leaves fall from the trees. It's quiet around the canyon and you don't have traffic jams and RVs all over and people everywhere with cameras and coolers. We have the Grand Canyon all to ourselves, it seems. It's like our backyard. I think we take it for granted. Sometimes I'm out with my mom in the car and we don't even look into the canyon. I've heard that people who live in New York City never even visit the Statue of Liberty. If I lived in New York, I'd be there every day! </p><p> <b>KELSEY DONNELLY. GRADE 6</b><br> A lot of kids are here in the summer, but they're just tourists. There aren't many kids who live around here, which kinda sucks because you just see the same old faces day after day after day. It's boring. Our school is small. Everybody knows what everybody else is up to. So you do one silly thing like dye your hair and it's, like, front-page news. I bet if I lived in a big city, nobody would even notice me. </p><p> We have only one sixth-grade class, so the four of us were together again. They wouldn't let us sit together, though. Oh no, they weren't about to make <i>that</i> mistake a second time. </p><p> <b>MR. MURPHY. SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> It's a shame what happened. That's all I can say. Take it all the way back to the beginning? Okay. </p><p> I'm retired United States Air Force, and I worked on the space program at NASA for many years. I guess I was just drawn to the canyon, like a lot of people. You know, one of the seven wonders of the world, and all that. I used to go rafting out here on the Colorado River in my younger days. </p><p> My wife and I moved from Houston to retire, but I couldn't stand doing nothing. I started hanging around the library, researching strange things that happened at the Grand Canyon. I thought maybe I'd write a book on the topic. But I'm the restless type. Can't sit still. So I went to school and took a few classes so I could get a teaching certificate. </p><p> The kids say I'm strict because I don't tolerate any foolishness. I suppose that's why I was hired. They wanted somebody who could keep the class in order, especially after what happened with those four. An authority figure, y'know? A military guy who would keep them in line. </p><p> But what happened, happened. I'm partly responsible, because I was there. I will never forget it. I feel deeply sorry about it. </p><p> <b>SAM DAWKINS. GRADE 6</b><br> Mr. Murphy looked like one of those drill sergeants you see in the movies. You know, he has a crew cut you could balance a soda can on. When he walked into the class for the first time in September, I thought we'd all have to snap to attention or start marching around the playground. I was afraid he was gonna take one look at my long hair and suspend me for life. </p><p> But my dad was in the military, so I'm used to guys like that. Mr. Murphy is cool, in a way. You know where you stand with him. He doesn't say one thing and mean something else, like a lot of other guys. If he's mad, he tells you. And if you do something good, he tells you that, too. </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> Mr. Murphy told us that he actually met Neil Armstrong, John Glenn, and all those other astronauts when he was working at NASA. Can you imagine? And here he was, teaching us. It was pretty neat, to think that there was just one degree of separation between me and the first man to walk on the moon. </p><p> <b>KELSEY DONNELLY. GRADE 6</b><br> Yeah, when we came back to school in September, we knew we would have to go back to doing our homework the old-fashioned way -- with pencils and papers and our brains. Ha! What a drag. I missed the homework machine. It was just so easy, sliding a work sheet into the computer and having your homework pop out of the printer a few minutes later -- finished, perfect, and even in my own handwriting! Man, that was great. I'm sure Snik missed having the homework machine around too. It probably didn't matter much to Brenton and Judy one way or the other, because they're geniuses anyway. I think they actually <i>like</i> doing homework. They're freaks. </p><p> <b>SAM DAWKINS. GRADE 6</b><br> I <i>still</i> hate homework. What a waste of time! But what are you gonna do? Kids don't rule the world. We've got no power. </p><p> <b>MR. MURPHY. SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> Let me see, what did we learn this year? Dividing by decimals. That was interesting. I had completely forgotten how to do it without a calculator. I had to learn all over again. I taught the kids the parts of speech too. A lot of kids have trouble with adverbs and adjectives. I like to tell them that it was a lot easier when I was their age -- there were only three parts of speech back then. American history was a lot easier to memorize too, because there were only thirteen states. Sometimes the kids don't get my jokes. </p><p> <b>SAM DAWKINS. GRADE 6</b><br> Mr. Murphy is pretty funny, for an old guy with a crew cut. He would let us joke around with him a little. But you had to be careful. If you crossed the line, he'd cut you down with a stare and let you know it was time to knock it off. </p><p> <b>MR. MURPHY. SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER</b><br> And of course in the sixth grade, we teach about ancient civilizations -- Egypt, the Aztecs, the Mayans, and the ancient Americans, too. The kids always joke that I know so much about that stuff because I lived through it. They crack me up. </p><p> <b>JUDY DOUGLAS. GRADE 6</b><br> I found the history of the Grand Canyon to be fascinating.

Sartre ultimately argues that by the very absence of &#x201c;a priori meaning,&#x201d; an individual can discover and shape his or her own significance and place in the world.&nbsp;Sartre turns the typical nihilistic definition of existentialism on its head in this optimistic take on his best-known theory.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre (1905&#x2013;1980) was a significant voice in the creation of existential thought. His explorations of the ways human existence is unique among all life-forms in its capacity to choose continue to influence fields such as Marxist philosophy, sociology, and literary studies. He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, but refused the honor.</p><h2>Amazon Highlights: Peru � Ecuador � Colombia � Brazil (Bradt Highlights Amazon)</h2><p><p>One-stop-shopping travel guide</p><p>The Amazon -- a region of mythic proportions, and of a mythic number of travel choices. Plenty of travel guides compare and contrast this or that hotel, lodge or restaurant in the various countries encompassed by the Amazon rainforest, and traversed by the world's biggest river. But when it comes to researching a trip that is right for you, an online search spills forth thousands of results. Online reviews only go so far. It is sometimes hard to tell if a review has been posted by the tour operator or lodge owner. That's where Amazon Highlights comes in. This book caters to the first-time Amazon traveler by narrowing down the choices.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on more than 20 years of travel to the region, leading natural history and photography tours, author Roger Harris shares his experience to explain to the reader exactly what to look for in a tour operator. A step-by-step checklist allows the reader to easily see "red flags" to steer them away from the "cowboys" and toward reputable, reliable tour operators.&nbsp; The book highlights the most reputable and eco-conscious "tried and trusted" tour operators and lodges, as well as the best travel opportunities the Amazon has to offer. The book includes several sponsored sections featuring carefully selected tour operators renowned for their reputation and expertise, thus providing the reader an "insider" perspective of the region's travel opportunities. </p><p>The book is lavishly illustrated with gorgeous photos, maps and even diagrams such as one that shows the variation in annual river level, and thus the best time to travel there. The author is a qualified biologist so the detailed natural history information is scientifically accurate. Comprising almost a third of the book, this section focuses on the animals and plants a first-time visitor is likely to see, rather than just the glamorous animals that are the sole interest of most travel guides or magazines. Other invaluable information includes health and safety, shopping tips, viewing wildlife and photography, and so much more. The book really does provide one-stop-shopping for a first-time traveller to the region.</p></p><p><p>Roger Harris has been travelling to the Amazon region for nearly 20 years, documenting the area's natural history.

Yet "pessimist" remains a term of abuse--an accusation of a bad attitude--or the diagnosis of an unhappy psychological state. Pessimism is thought of as an exclusively negative stance that inevitably leads to resignation or despair. Even when pessimism looks like utter truth, we are told that it makes the worst of a bad situation. Bad for the individual, worse for the species--who would actually counsel pessimism?</p><br><p> Joshua Foa Dienstag does. In <i>Pessimism</i>, he challenges the received wisdom about pessimism, arguing that there is an unrecognized yet coherent and vibrant pessimistic philosophical tradition. More than that, he argues that pessimistic thought may provide a critically needed alternative to the increasingly untenable progressivist ideas that have dominated thinking about politics throughout the modern period. Laying out powerful grounds for pessimism's claim that progress is not an enduring feature of human history, Dienstag argues that political theory must begin from this predicament. He persuasively shows that pessimism has been--and can again be--an energizing and even liberating philosophy, an ethic of radical possibility and not just a criticism of faith. The goal--of both the pessimistic spirit and of this fascinating account of pessimism--is not to depress us, but to edify us about our condition and to fortify us for life in a disordered and disenchanted universe.</p></p><p><p>"It seems that with each passing day the faith in progress becomes less sustainable, less believable, whether one consults environmental, social, or political data. The pessimistic tradition, having confronted the human situation without relying upon this faith, affords us a diverse wealth of resources for going on and even for doing worthy things. Dienstag justifies his dramatic claim that we have been ignoring the pessimistic tradition to our own impoverishment. But his articulation of this tradition, as befits the pessimistic spirit, is provisional and an invitation to others to join in its exploration. There is no other book quite like Dienstag's."<b>--Melissa A. Orlie, University of Illinois</b></p><p>"I think this book is successful in what it sets out to do. It is extremely ambitious: it seeks to recast European political thought over the last 300 years and to make that recasting appealing to contemporary readers. I concur with most of the analyses and in all cases they are creative and enlightening."<b>--Tracy Strong, University of California, San Diego</b></p><b>Joshua Foa Dienstag</b> is Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Here a rhythmic, vivid evocation from eyewitness Angelo Quattrocchi is complemented by Tom Nairn&#x2019;s cool and elegant appraisal to tell the astonishing story of those heady days. Paris is a seething battlefield of barricades, burning cars and CS gas. De Gaulle&#x2019;s riot police publicly inform him that their loyalty can no longer be taken for granted. Meanwhile students and millions of young striking workers on the streets raise ideas that had previously been the sole province of radical philosophers: &#x201c;To forbid is forbidden&#x201d;; &#x201c;Be reasonable ... Demand the impossible&#x201d;; &#x201c;Freedom is the consciousness of our desires.&#x201d;</p><p>Anarchist and poet, <b>Angelo Quattrocchi</b> (1945&#x2013;2009) reported from London, Paris and the US for Italian newspapers in the 1960s and 1970s and subsequently worked as a scriptwriter for the BBC, Channel 4, and Italian television. His books include<i> The Beginning of the End: France, May 1968, What Happened, Why It Happened</i> with Tom Nairn.<br><br><b>Tom Nairn</b>&#x2018;s many books include <i>The Break-up of Britain, Faces of Nationalism, After Britain</i>, and <i>The Enchanted Glass</i>. He writes for, among others, <i>New Left Review</i> and the <i>London Review of Books</i>.<br><br><b>Tariq Ali</b> is a writer and filmmaker. He has written more than a dozen books on world history and politics&#x2014;including <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>, <i>Bush in Babylon</i>, <i>The Clash of Fundamentalisms</i> and <i>The Obama Syndrome</i>&#x2014;as well as five novels in his Islam Quintet series and scripts for the stage and screen. He is an editor of the <i>New Left Review</i> and lives in London.Italian TV scriptwriter Quattrocchi and Edinburgh, Scotland-based teacher and political writer Nairn have written two entirely different essays for the 30th anniversary of the French student riots, and combined to make this very short book about a very challenging subject. Nairn's flat prose about the political motivations is not original but at least is readable, although marred by cliched chapter headings like "The Last Comedy of Capitalism" and "A New Subjectivity." But this book errs badly in printing Quattrocchi's "contemporary fable" titled "What Happened," which reads like a combination of a hokey "atmospheric" radio script and John Berger after too many Camparis. Quattrocchi offers a myopic view of the events of the student revolution, with so many arcane references and French terms that only a reader thoroughly familiar with the 1968 revolution will have any idea of what he is getting at, and even then, what he adds in the way of perspectives and comments are not exactly illuminating. Parts sound like a bad translation of Genet: "The mass copulation with fear has left behind its sportcars hooting obscenities. Young puppets tenderly nursed by midwife flics." Readers truly interested in ideas about political revolution will want to read theorists like Hannah Arendt, Leo Strauss, Raymond Aron, among others, as an antidote to this curious, unhelpful production. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The English Civil War, 1642-1651: An illustrated military history</h2><p>This volume focuses on the military aspects of the English Civil War.

He had the place to himself. In fact, he seemed to have most of the five boroughs to himself. Labor Day weekend. And a hot one. Anyone who could afford to had fled upstate or to the Long Island beaches. The rest were inside, slumped before their air conditioners. Even the homeless were off the streets, crouched in the relative cool of the subways.<br>The sun poured liquid fire through the hazy midday sky. Not a cloud in sight. But here in the shade of this leaning oak, Mr. Veilleur knew the weather was going to change soon, could read it from the worsening ache in his knees, hips, and back.<br>Other things were going to change as well. Everything, perhaps. And all for the worse.<br>He had been making sporadic trips to this corner of the cemetery since he&#x2019;d first sensed the <i>wrongness</i> here. That had been on a snowy winter night many years ago. It had taken him a while, but he&#x2019;d finally located the spot.<br>A grave, which was perfectly natural, this being a cemetery. This grave was not like the others, however. This one had no marker. But something else made this grave special: Nothing would grow over it.<br>Through the years Mr. Veilleur had seen the cemetery&#x2019;s gardeners try to seed it, sod it, even plant it with various ground covers like periwinkle, pachysandra, and ivy. They took root well all around, but nothing survived in the four-foot oblong patch over the grave.<br>Of course, they didn&#x2019;t know it was a grave. Only Mr. Veilleur and the one who had dug the hole knew that. And surely one other.<br>Mr. Veilleur did not come here often. Travel was not easy for him, even to another part of the city he had called home since the end of World War Two. Gone were the days when he walked where he wished, fearing no one. Now his eyes were bad; his back was stiff and canted forward; he leaned on a cane when he walked, and he walked slowly. He had an old man&#x2019;s body and he had to take appropriate precautions.<br>Age had not dampened his curiosity, however. He didn&#x2019;t know who had dug the grave, or who was in it. But whoever lay down there below the dirt and rocks had been touched by the enemy&nbsp;... the Otherness.<br>The enemy had been growing steadily stronger for more than two decades now. But growing carefully, staying hidden. Good thing too, for he had no one to oppose him. But he did not know that. He was waiting. For what? A sign? A particular event? Perhaps the one buried below was part of the answer. Perhaps the occupant had nothing to do with the enemy&#x2019;s quiescence.<br>No matter&#x2014;as long as the enemy remained inactive. For the longer the enemy delayed, the closer Mr. Veilleur would be to reaching the end of his days. And then he would be spared witnessing the chaotic horrors to come. His Heir would shoulder that burden.<br>A shadow fell across him and a sudden gust of wind chilled the perspiration that coated his skin. He looked up. Clouds were moving in, obscuring the sun. Time to go.<br>He stood and stared one last time at the bare dirt over the unmarked grave. He knew he would be back again. And again. Too many questions about this grave and its occupant. He sensed unfinished business here.<br>Because the grave&#x2019;s occupant did not rest easy. Did not, in fact, rest at all.<br>Mr. Veilleur turned and made his unsteady way out of St. Ann&#x2019;s cemetery. It would be good to get back to the cool apartment and get his feet up and have a glass of iced tea. He tried to believe that his wife had missed him during his absence, but with her mind the way it was, Magda probably hadn&#x2019;t even realized he was gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2005, 2011 by F.

There are now thirteen Nobu restaurants in New York, Los Angeles, Malibu, Aspen, Las Vegas, London, Milan and Tokyo."Beautiful, educational and inspiring." ?Ann Prichard, <i>USA Today</i><br>"The best food photography I have ever seen...." ?Paul Levy, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"... part memoir, part manual of techniques and recipes, part glossy picture book?from nightstand to coffee table and back to kitchen counter." ?<i>Gourmet</i><br>"In his first cookbook, <i>Nobu: the Cookbook</i>, Nobu Matsuhisa shares the secrets of his trend-setting new-style sashimi, his often-copied black cod with miso, and his sea-urchin tempura (a "Tim Zagat favorite!")...Sprinkled among the intriguing recipes and stunning photographs are an aji-to-yuzu glossary, a shopping guide, and helpful tips on how to de-slime octopus and the proper way to eat sushi (dip the topping, not the rice)." ?<i>New York Magazine</i><br>"... the exciting ideas presented here are challenging and full of expansive knowledge." ?<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"Those who pursue the pleasures purveyed by Nobu will find this cookbook to be a highly polished gem, and will be able to treat their guests to a symphony of texture and flavors." ?<i>Sacramento Bee</i><br>"A hot seller with chefs." ?<i>The Province</i><br>"A array of seafood dishes to amaze you." ?<i>The Post and Courier</i><br>"The cookbook is a work of art, as are the dishes in it." ?<i>Norwich Bulletin</i><br>"... reveals the secrets of his cooking and indeed the essence of all Japanese cuisine." ?Espritline.com<br>"An essential addition to any collection of chefs' cookbooks." ?<i>Library Journal</i><br>"... stunning and well-designed with loads of gorgeous color photographs of wonderful looking dishes." ?<i>Los Angeles Daily News</i><br>"The book may be worth owning on the merits of its photographs alone...." ?John Martin, <i>The Bloomsbury Review</i><br>"The instructions for constructing his beautifully compiled dishes are surprisingly easy...." ?<i>Decanter</i><br>"The full-color photos make you hungry; the step-by-step directions are thorough." ?Cathy Thomas, <i>Orange Country Register</i><br>"Nobu Matsuhisa's masterpiece of wonderfully detailed dishes showcases his art of combining cultures." ?Rita DeMontis, <i>Toronto Sun</i><br>"... the book shows off the beauty of his Asian fusion creations." ?Gita Sitaramiah, <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i><br>"... this beautifully photographed book provides a range of authentic recipes (mostly seafood) with good detail and tips." ?Marilynn Marter, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br>"In addition to the expected array of cuisine, Nobu educates the reader....

Howard Eaton, an intrepid guide who had become known for his Yellowstone experience, had convinced Rinehart to make the trek to the West. Traveling three hundred miles on horseback with a group of more than forty assorted tourists of all shapes and sizes, she took in her fellow travelers, the scenery, and the travel itself with all the style and aplomb and humor of the talented fiction writer and journalist she was. Reprinted here with a foreword by, her grandson, publishing&#39;s Rick Rinehart, her words remain fresh and entertaining to this day.</p><p>Mary Roberts Rinehart (August 12, 1876 &#x2013; September 22, 1958) was an American writer who has frequently been called the American Agatha Christie. Wildly popular in the 1910s and 1920s, her mystery novels are still read and referenced in the twenty-first century. Also widely traveled in the West, she toured Glacier National Park with Howard Eaton in 1915, when it was newly minted. Her travelogues on Glacier helped popularize the parks and offer a glimpse into an earlier time that is still appealing today.</p><h2>Boy-Crazy Stacey (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 8)</h2><p>Baby-sitting for the Pike family at the Jersey shore, Stacey and Mary Anne anticipate two weeks of sun, sand, and boys, and when Stacey falls for a cute lifeguard, Mary Anne winds up doing the work of two baby-sitters.

Allison B. Gilmore makes a strong case for the importance of psychological warfare in this theater, countering the usual view of fanatical resistance by Japanese units. Gilmore marshals evidence that Japanese military indoctrination did not produce soldiers who were invulnerable to demoralization and the survival instinct.</p><p>Allison B. Gilmore is an associate professor of history at The Ohio State University&nbsp;at Lima."Ironically, while Hollywood films and popular American stereotypes that persist to the present portray the Japanese soldiers as fanatics who would never surrender, the U.S. military . . . took a more realistic view and engaged in a sustained campaign to undermine the morale of the Japanese army. . . .

Now, in their official oral history, founding members John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin take readers behind the scenes in this no-holds-barred look at their lives and unforgettable comic works like "The Spanish Inquisition," "Dead Parrot," <em>Monty Python's Life of Brian</em>, <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> (inspiration for the hit Broadway musical <em>Spamalot</em>), and many, many more, with never-before-seen photos and rare interviews from friends and collaborators.</p></p><p>Sensibly eschewing any attempt to emulate the inspired lunacy of Monty Python's Flying Circus, this excellent oral history offers instead a straightforward but fascinating peek behind the scenes. Extensive interviews with the team of madmen who created the legendary British television series and four feature films (except Graham Chapman, who died in 1989) give a vivid sense of the dynamic interplay of personalities that revolutionized contemporary comedy, disdaining punch lines and blackout skits in favor of something much weirder and more free-form. The writing duo of Cambridge grads Chapman and John Cleese favored confrontational, deliberately shocking pieces like the infamous Undertaker sketch ("I think we've got an eater!"). Oxford alums Terry Jones and Michael Palin took a more surreal approach to writing ("Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition"). And Eric Idle, who preferred to write alone, was the cheeky one ("nudge, nudge") as well as a respected sounding board for others' ideas. Terry Gilliam, the sole American, provided the wacky animation that gave the show its visual style. It was, as Gilliam remarks, "this amazing chemical balance... I don't think you could invent a group that would work better." All the Pythons are frank about personal and creative differences, making this a thoughtful assessment rather than a hagiography. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>David Morgan is the author of <em>Monty Python Speaks!</em> (Spike, 1999) and editor of <em>Sundancing</em> (Spike, 2000).

In one, we sit with the teenage Mark Strand while he reads for the first time a poem that truly amazes him: "You, Andrew Marvell" by Archibald MacLeish, in which night sweeps in an unstoppable but exhilarating circle around the earth toward the speaker standing at noon. The essay goes on to explicate the poem, but it also evokes, through its form and content, the poem's meaning -- time's circular passage -- with the young Strand first happening upon the poem, the older Strand seeing into it differently, but still amazed. <br><br>Among the other subjects Strand explores: the relationship between photographs and poems, the eternal nature of the lyric, the contemporary use of old forms, four American views of Parnassus, and an alphabet of poetic influences.<br><br>We visit as well Strandian parallel universes, whose absurdity illuminates the lack of a vital discussion of poetry in our culture at large: Borges drops in on a man taking a bath, perches on the edge of the tub, and discusses translation; a president explains in his farewell address why he reads Chekhov to his cabinet.<br><br>Throughout <b>The Weather of Words</b>, Mark Strand explores the crucial job of poets and their readers, who together joyfully attempt the impossible -- to understand through language that which lies beyond words.</p><p>"A primer on the magnanimity of poetry, with selected essays, criticism, reflections and inventions. Together they form a creed, which is this: A poem is the unassailable expression of what cannot be expressed in any other way... Poetry is ubiquitous and contagious, hilarious and holy; it bewitches children and converts housewives. Few American poets still write with joy and charmed irony, but in Strand the elation had not diminished."<br>--Sara Miller, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>Mark Strand was born in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada, and was raised and educated in the United States. He has written nine books of poems, which have brought him many honors and grants, including a MacArthur Fellowship and the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for <b>Blizzard of One</b>. He was chosen as Poet Laureate of the United States in 1990. He is also the author of a book of stories, <b>Mr. and Mrs. Baby</b>, several volumes of translations (works by Raphael Alberti and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, among others), the editor of a number of anthologies, and the author of two monographs on contemporary artists (William Bailey and Edward Hopper).

In <i>Gathering the Desert</i> readers will discover that the bounty of the desert is much more than meets the eye&#x2014;whether found in the luscious fruit of the stately organpipe cactus or in the lowly tepary bean. Nabhan has chosen a dozen of the more than 425 edible wild species found in the Sonoran Desert to demonstrate just how bountiful the land can be. From the red-hot chiltepines of Mexico to the palms of Palm Springs, each plant exemplifies a symbolic or ecological relationship which people of this region have had with plants through history. Each chapter focuses on a particular plant and is accompanied by an original drawing by artist Paul Mirocha. Word and picture together create a total impression of plants and people as the book traces the turn of seasons in the desert.</p><p>Gathering the Desert explores desert plants as calories, cures, and characters and in what season they can be found.A MacArthur Fellow and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Conservation Biology, <b>Gary Paul Nabhan</b> is Director of the Center for Sustainable Environments at Northern Arizona University.</p><h2>Monster Mythology (Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dungeon Master's Guide Rules Supplement/2128/Dm5r4)</h2><p>Learn all about the avatars and shamans of giants, goblins, the underdark, even illithids and beholders, in this expansion of the popular Legends &amp; Lore.</p><p></p><h2>Parlour Song Book</h2><p>This volume contains 71 songs for voice &amp; piano running from the sublime to the ridiculous &amp; represent all the important types of song: *Sentimental *Descriptive *Pathetic &amp; proselytizing *Dominant themes &amp; preoccupations of the time *Love, death, childhood, home patriotism, social &amp; oral improvement *From the principal contemporary sources: opera, ballad concerts, family troupes, the minstrels &amp; the musical hall The editor provides witty &amp; knowledgeable commentary on the composers, lyricists, &amp; sources then in vogue.</p><p></p><h2>Blood of a Dragon</h2><p>It wa definite -- Dumery had no magical talent at all.

In Walker's estimation, the author of Native Son and Black Boy hated black women and treated the two white women he married sadistically. Self-hatred pushed Wright to conceive of himself as "a white American with a black skin," even as he plunged into Pan-Africanism, Marxism and Freud for an anchor to his fractured self. Walker ( Jubilee ) and Wright were friends in the 1930s when they both worked on the WPA Writers' Project in Chicago. Combining biography, criticism and memoir, this excellent, flesh-and-blood portrait gets closer to the inner man than any previous volume. The author's claim for Wright as a Southern Gothic writer as well as an Afro-American one is buttressed by her intense account of his formative years in rural Mississippi. She also limns his bohemian life in New York and Paris, where he wrote eight books, unjustly neglected today.

She now writes bestselling single title cowboy and country music mass market romances. Born in Texas and raised in southern Oklahoma, Carolyn and her husband now make their home in the town of Davis, Oklahoma.</p>The lights went out in Henrietta, Texas.<br> Everything west of the bridge into town was black: no streetlights and very few humming generators. But the flashing neon sign advertising the Longhorn Inn motel still flickered on and off, showing a bowlegged old cowboy wearing six guns, a ten-gallon hat, and a big smile as he pointed toward the vacancy sign at his feet.<br> Santa Claus and a cold north wind kept everyone inside that Christmas Eve night and there were no customers, which was fine with the new owner, Pearl Richland. She could cuss, stomp, and pout about operating a damn motel in north Texas rather than spending the holiday in Savannah with her southern relatives, and no one would hear a thing. Not even her mother, who had told her she was making the biggest mistake of her life when she quit her banking job in Durant, Oklahoma, and moved to Henrietta, Texas.<br> "Entrepreneur! Running a fifty-year-old motel and cleaning rooms is not an entrepreneur. You are ruining your life, Katy Pearl Richland," her mother had said.<br> But Pearl had always loved the time she spent at the motel when she was a kid, and after sitting at the loan officer's desk in a bank, she had a hankering to be on the other side. The one where she was the person with a new business and bright, fresh ideas as to how to improve it.<br> Now she was, but it did have a price to pay. Pearl, the party girl, was now an entrepreneur and had more work than she could keep up with and hadn't been out on a date in months. Hard work, she didn't mind. Long hours, she didn't mind. Online classes with research projects that took a chunk of her days, she didn't mind. Not dating-that she minded a helluva lot.<br> Pearl put the finishing touches on the assignments for the two online motel hospitality classes she was taking out of Midwestern University in Wichita Falls. One needed a few tweaks, but she'd have it done by New Year's, and then she'd enroll in more courses, which would begin the middle of January.<br> She was on her way to the kitchen to see if Santa Claus had left something wonderful like double fudge brownies in her cabinet when all hell broke loose. She thought about that guy in the poem about the night before Christmas as she ran to the window and peeked out at all the vehicles crunching gravel under their wheels-cars, vans, trucks. She wouldn't have been surprised to see a fat feller dressed in red with tiny reindeer stopping an oversized sleigh in amongst all those vehicles.<br> She hustled back to the check-in counter and put on her best smile as she looked at the crowd pushing their way toward the door. The tiny lobby of the twenty-five-unit 1950s-style motel didn't offer breakfast, not even donuts and coffee. That was something on her list for the future, right along with a major overhaul when she decided whether she wanted to go modern or rustic. It didn't have a crystal chandelier or a plasma television. It did have two brown leather recliners with a small table between them. In addition to the recliners, it was now packed with people all talking so loudly that it overpowered the whistling wind of the Texas blue norther that had hit an hour earlier.<br> She was reminded of Toby Keith's song "I Love This Bar." He sang about hookers, lookers, and bikers. Well, if he'd loved her motel instead of a bar he could have added a bride and groom, a pissed off granny who was trying to corral a bunch of bored teenage grandchildren, and sure enough there was Santa Claus over there in the corner. Pearl didn't see anyone offering to sit on his chubby knees, but maybe that was because he'd taken off his hat and his fake beard. He was bald except for a rim of curly gray hair that ended, of all things, in a ponytail about three inches long at his neck.<br> Pearl raised her voice. "Who was here first?"<br> The door opened and four more people crowded into the room, letting in a blast of freezing air that made everyone shiver.<br> A young man in a tuxedo stepped up to the tall desk separating the lobby from the office. "That would be us."<br> "Fill out this card. Rooms are all alike. Two double beds, micro-fridge, and free wireless Internet," Pearl said.<br> A girl in a long white velvet dress hugged up to his side. "We sure aren't interested in Internet or a microwave oven tonight. This is so quaint and very romantic, and it's got all we need... a bed!"<br> The man took time out from the card to kiss her.<br> <i>Quaint and romantic? Pearl thought. It's more like the motel in that old movie Psycho. But I do like the idea of quaint and romantic. Hadn't thought of that, but it has a nice ring for a black-and-white brochure. Visit the quaint and romantic inn... I like it.</i><br> Built in a low spot on the east side of town more than half a century before, it had a rough, weathered wood exterior that had turned gray with wind, rain, sleet, and pure old Texas heat; wind-out windows that used to work before air conditioning had been installed (now they'd been painted shut); a covered walkway all the way around the U-shaped building; and a gravel parking lot.<br> Pearl had twenty-five units and it was beginning to look like it really could be a full house. That meant she'd be cleaning a hell of a lot of rooms on Christmas Day because Rosa, the lady who'd helped her Aunt Pearlita for the past twenty years, decided to retire when Pearlita passed away in the fall.<br> While Mrs. Bride whispered love words in Mr. Bridegroom's ear, Pearl looked out over the impatient crowd. Santa good-naturedly waited his turn, but the lady behind him with six teenagers in tow looked like she could chew up railroad spikes and spit out ten penny nails.<br> Maybe Pearl needed to sit on Santa's lap and ask if he'd send his elves to help clean the rooms the next day. Cleaning hadn't been a problem because renting five or six units a night was the norm up until that moment. The east side of the motel had ten units along with Pearl's apartment. The bottom of the U had five units and a laundry room, and the west side had ten units. There was parking for one vehicle per room with extra parking for big trucks behind the laundry room. Part of her last online assignment was designing charts to make a few more spots in the wide middle. Even if she implemented the idea, it couldn't happen until spring. Winter, even in Texas, wasn't the right season to pour concrete.<br> The motel area had been carved out of a stand of mesquite trees fifty-plus years before, and every few years Pearlita had ordered a couple of truckloads of new gravel for the center lot and the drive around the outside edge. She'd declared that concrete was hot and that it made the place too modern, but Pearl figured she couldn't afford the concrete. When she saw the savings account her aunt left in her name, she changed her mind. Aunt Pearlita was just plain tight.</p><h2>Come, Thief. Jane Hirshfield</h2><p>Jane Hirshfield is a visionary American writer whose poems ask nothing less than what it is to be human. Both sensual meditations and passionate investigations, they reveal complex truths in language luminous and precise. Rooted in the living world, her poems celebrate and elucidate a hard-won affirmation of our human fate. Born of a rigorous questioning of heart, spirit and mind, they have become indispensable to many American readers in navigating their own lives. Bloodaxe published her retrospective Each Happiness Ringed by Lions: Selected Poems in 2005, followed by After in 2006, a Poetry Book Society Choice which was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize. The focus of her latest collection, Come, Thief, is beauty, time, and the full embrace of an existence that time cannot help but steal from our arms. To read these startlingly true poems is to find our own feelings eloquently ensnared. Whether delving into intimately familiar moments or bringing forward some experience until now outside words, Hirshfield finds for each facet of our lives its metamorphosing portrait, its particular memorable, singing and singular name.</p><p>Jane Hirshfield was born in 1953 in New York and lives in northern California. Her first book of poetry published in the UK was Each Happiness Ringed by Lions: Selected Poems (Bloodaxe Books, 2005), which draws on her collections Alaya (1982), Of Gravity &amp; Angels (1988), The October Palace (1994), The Lives of the Heart (1997) and Given Sugar, Given Salt (2001). This was followed by two later collections, After (Bloodaxe Books, 2006), a Poetry Book Society Choice, which was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize, and Come, Thief (Bloodaxe Books, 2012). In 2008 Bloodaxe published Jane Hirshfield's lectures Hiddenness, Surprise, Uncertainly: Three Generative Energies of Poetry (Newcastle/ Bloodaxe Poetry Lectures). Jane Hirshfield edited the bestselling anthology Women in Praise of the Sacred (1994), and co-translated The Ink Dark Moon: Poems by Ono No Komachi and Izumi Shikibu (1988) - another bestseller in the States - and, with Robert Bly, Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems (2004).

Lia Matera<br>By the Anthony Award-winning author of "I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia," another Amanda Pepper mystery. Well-known Broadway playwright and TV producer Lyle Zacharias is throwing himself a lavish birthday party in his hometown of Philadelphia. Guests include his current wife, ex-wives, friends, former partners -- not to mention Amanda Pepper and her own irrepressible mother, Bea. Yet when Lyle drops dead in the middle of a speech, it appears the likely perpetrator is none other than Bea, whose gift was fifty delicious, but apparently poisoned, tarts!<br>It's up to Amanda to clear her mother's name and find the real murderer . . . before he or she strikes again! But Amanda herself may be the next target! Who says teaching isn't exciting? With any more excitement, Amanda will have to retire before she hits thirty-one . . . if she lives that long!<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Even before I became her editor, starting with her third mystery novel, I was enamored of Gillian Roberts and the Philadelphia-set series she writes about schoolteacher Amanda Pepper. (The author herself was once a schoolteacher in Philadelphia, so she knows whereof she writes.) Gillian's debut, CAUGHT DEAD IN PHILADELPHIA, justly won the Anthony Award for Best First Novel. And subsequent installments confirmed the promise of that first book. What's special about all the Amanda Pepper novels is Amanda's voice (i.e., Gillian's first-person narration): wry, commonsensical, and with commentary that alternates between compassionate and laugh-aloud funny. Maybe the best way to describe the appeal of Gillian Roberts is to quote another top-echelon crime novelist, Nancy Pickard, who says, "Here's the Dorothy Parker of mystery writers, laughing even when -- especially when -- it hurts, and giving more wit per page than most writers give per book." All I'll add is: don't miss Gillian Roberts!<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate PublisherPhiladelphia's high-school teacher/sometime sleuth Amanda Pepper (I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia, etc.) dutifully escorts her mother Bea to a 50th birthday-party bash--an event paid for by playwright-TV producer Lyle Zacharias, who wants all the important influences in his life at this party he's hosting at a small hotel. But those past relationships take on new significance when Lyle dies of poison after eating dinner. Bimbo-ish current wife Tiffany, having an affair with actor-guest Shepard McCoy, is underwhelmed with sorrow--ditto second wife Sybil, in attendance with her and Lyle's teenaged son Reed. Terry Wiley, a high-school pal whose work Lyle seems to have plagiarized and built a career on, is there, too, and the father-daughter team who own the hotel might also have had a bitter score to settle with the charming, satanic Lyle. Only aged Aunt Hattie seems truly grieved--as Amanda and her policeman friend McKenzie slowly pull together long-buried secrets to reach a tortured conclusion. The road there is a bit tortured, too- -through thickets of Amanda's sometimes witty but mostly self- absorbed meanderings. Blithe but bloated, and only sporadically engrossing. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She lives on Long Island.</p>Again, Isaacs's (Magic Hour, etc.) formulaic plot device is almost beside the point as she tickles readers' funny bones in her latest Long Island melodrama-cum-satire--this time featuring a middle-aged millionairess who's accused of her estranged husband's murder. ``After nearly a quarter of a century of marriage, Richie Meyers, my husband, told me to call him Rick,'' reports Rosie Meyers, a high-school English teacher whose husband struck it rich years before by cofounding a computer-research firm and thereby launching the two of them into the stratosphere of Long Island monied society. Had she not been so cheerfully enmeshed in her resolutely middle-class teaching career, Rosie adds, she might have seen the writing on the wall: Richie was in the midst of a midlife crisis that featured an affair with Data Associates's very young and very blond vice-president, Jessica Stevenson. Weeping (unrepentantly), Richie leaves Rosie shortly after their silver wedding anniversary, and Rosie suffers one long, miserable, solitary summer--until one night, woken from a Xanax-induced slumber, she stumbles across Richie on her kitchen floor, stabbed to death with one of her own carving knives. The police assume the spurned wife is the culprit, and Rosie is forced to flee to Manhattan to do her own investigating and prove them wrong. Along the way she learns some hard truths about her husband's secret life, and though the true killer's identity becomes clear far too early, Isaacs's ability to keep readers laughing through Rosie's darkest moments should prove cathartic for many among her loyal readers.

So when American physician Sumner Jackson, who lived with his wife and young son Phillip at Number 11, found himself drawn into the Liberation network of the French resistance, he knew the stakes were impossibly high. Just down the road at Number 31 was the "mad sadist" Theodor Dannecker, an Eichmann prot�g� charged with deporting French Jews to concentration camps. And Number 84 housed the Parisian headquarters of the Gestapo, run by the most effective spy hunter in Nazi Germany. <br><br>From his office at the American Hospital, itself an epicenter of Allied and Axis intrigue, Jackson smuggled fallen Allied fighter pilots safely out of France, a job complicated by the hospital director's close ties to collaborationist Vichy. After witnessing the brutal round-up of his Jewish friends, Jackson invited Liberation to officially operate out of his home at Number 11&#x2014;but the noose soon began to tighten. When his secret life was discovered by his Nazi neighbors, he and his family were forced to undertake a journey into the dark heart of the war-torn continent from which there was little chance of return.<br><br>Drawing upon a wealth of primary source material and extensive interviews with Phillip Jackson, Alex Kershaw recreates the City of Light during its darkest days.

Burroughs</h2><p>&#34;In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen. The dogma of science is that the will cannot possibly affect external forces, and I think that&#39;s just ridiculous. It&#39;s as bad as the church. My viewpoint is the exact contrary of the scientific viewpoint. I believe that if you run into somebody in the street it&#39;s for a reason. Among primitive people they say that if someone was bitten by a snake he was murdered. I believe that.&#34; - William S. Burroughs In Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs, his biographer Ted Morgan wrote: &#39;As the single most important thing about Graham Greene was his viewpoint as a lapsed Catholic, the single most important thing about Burroughs was his belief in the magical universe. The same impulse that lead him to put out curses was, as he saw it, the source of his writing...&#39; Burroughs&#39; writings often describe magical, mystical or occult ideas - Invocations of Elder Gods, descriptions of Sex-Magick rituals, references to amulets, charms, ghosts, omens and spells - all the thematic set-dressing that we all know and love, from Hammer Horror Movies to Weird Tales, from H. P. Lovecraft to Dennis Wheatley and The X-Files... Then there is his personal involvement with belief systems and practices that come from strange &#39;other&#39; territories outside the conventional mainstream - Scientology, Electronic Voice Phenomena,Orgone Accumulators; Ayahuasca, Rites of Pan in Morocco, Sweat-Lodges with Native American and, Chaos Magic. &#34;Stevens has unravelled the threads to create a superlative supernatural treatise of El Hombre Invisible&#39;s life and work.

But he knew instinctively that if he opened his mouth to try and suck in a breath, he would die.<br><br>Gritting his teeth fiercely, Murphy opened his eyes instead. And a pair of yellow, animal eyes stared back. Then a wildly gaping jaw came into focus through the greenish gloom, pointed teeth bared in a silent snarl. Murphy reached out, expecting the teeth to clamp down on his hand, but the dog face had disappeared, sucked back into the watery darkness.<br><br>It was no good. He had to get some air into his lungs before they burst. He turned his face upward, toward the feeble light, and after an agonizing few seconds during which he had the horrifying sense that he was sinking, not rising, his head broke the surface.<br><br>He sucked in a huge, spluttering breath, simultaneously grabbing on to the narrow stone ledge that projected from the side of the pit. Resting his head against the jagged rock, he could feel something warm mingling with the freezing water. Blood. As the pain suddenly hit him, a wild carousel of thoughts started racing round his brain.<br><br>Laura. He would never see her again. She wouldn&#x2019;t even know he had died here, in this remote, godforsaken place. She would never know his last thoughts had been about her.<br><br>Then he remembered. Laura was dead. She&#x2019;d died in his arms. <br><br>And now he was about to join her. With that thought, his body seemed to relax, accepting its fate, and he felt himself slipping back into the surging torrent.<br><br>No! He couldn&#x2019;t give up. He couldn&#x2019;t let the crazy old man win at last. He had to find a way out.<br>But first he had to find those puppies. <br><br>Clutching the ledge with both hands, Murphy took a series of quick, deep breaths, hyperventilating to force as much oxygen as possible into his lungs. He&#x2019;d done enough cave diving to know he could stay under a full two minutes if he had to. But that was under ideal conditions. Right now he had to contend with the effects of shock, blood loss, and bone-shaking cold&#x2013;all the while trying to find two little dogs somewhere in a swirling maelstrom. As he let himself slip back under the freezing water, he wondered&#x2013;not for the first time&#x2013;how he managed to get himself into these messes.<br><br>The answer was simple. One word: Methuselah. <br><br>Murphy had been making his way carefully through the cave, fanning his flashlight across the dank black walls, when he found himself standing not on loose shale but what felt like solid wooden planks. Ever alert to tricks and traps, Murphy instinctively reacted as if he&#x2019;d just stepped onto a tray of burning coals&#x2013;but before he could leap aside, the trapdoor sprang open. As he felt himself plunging into the void, a familiar cackling laugh shattered the silence, echoing crazily off the rock walls. <br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to the game, Murphy! Get out of this one if you can!&#x201d;<br><br>As Murphy cartwheeled through space, his brain was still trying to come up with a suitable response. But all that came out was a grunt as he slammed into the ground like a bag of cement and the air was punched out of his lungs, before the impact flung him sideways and his head connected with a boulder. For a moment all was black, buzzing darkness. Then he raised himself up on his hands and knees and his senses returned one by one: He could feel the damp grit between his fingers; he could taste it in his mouth; he could smell stagnant water; he could dimly make out the shadowy walls of the pit he&#x2019;d fallen into.<br><br>And he could hear the fretful whining of what sounded like two cold, wet&#x2013;and very scared&#x2013;little dogs.<br>He turned toward the sound and there they were, shivering together on a narrow ledge. A pair of German shepherd puppies. Murphy shook his head: He always tried to prepare himself for anything where Methuselah was concerned, but what were a couple of puppies doing in the middle of an underground cave complex miles from anywhere? Could they have gotten lost and somehow wandered this far from the surface? He didn&#x2019;t think so. Much more likely they were there because Methuselah had put them there. <br><br>They were part of the game.<br><br>Fighting his natural instinct to gather the bedraggled pups tightly in his arms and tell them everything was going to be okay, he approached the ledge cautiously. They looked so helpless. But that didn&#x2019;t mean harmless. Nothing in Methuselah&#x2019;s games was harmless, and if he had put them there for Murphy to find, then something about the dogs was out of whack. He just had to figure out what.<br><br>Just then the steady dripping sound that had been nagging away at the back of Murphy&#x2019;s consciousness since he landed in the pit started to get louder. He turned in the direction of the noise and suddenly it became a roaring, as a huge wave of water surged through a narrow gap in the rocks. In a second a frothing tide was tugging at his ankles, pulling him off balance. Forgetting Methuselah&#x2019;s mind games, he pushed himself back toward the ledge, scooped up the puppies, and stuffed them under his jacket. His eyes darted round the walls of the pit, looking for anything that would help him find a way out, as the rising water swirled around his chest. The puppies were just a diversion, he thought bitterly, fighting to keep his footing. He hadn&#x2019;t spotted the real danger until it was too late. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, fellas, I&#x2019;ll get you out of here,&#x201d; he assured them with more confidence than he felt. Then the torrent lifted him off his feet and the panicking dogs squirmed out of his jacket. Fighting to keep his head above the surface, he grabbed for them, but his fingers closed on icy water and then he too was engulfed, spinning out of control like a bunch of wet clothes in a Laundromat washer.<br><br>He closed his eyes, and even as his lungs started hungrily demanding air, he tried to find a calm place in his mind where he could think. He checked through his options. The water would soon reach the level of the trapdoor, which was no doubt secured against escape. So, search for another way out under the water, or look for the puppies again before they drowned? If he tried to find a way out on his own, the puppies would be dead by the time he found it. If he tried to save the puppies first, he&#x2019;d probably wind up too exhausted to find a way out. If there was a way out.<br><br>So much for his options.<br><br>The only shred of hope he could cling to was the fact that this was a game. And a game, however deadly, still had rules. <br><br>But there was no way he could figure them out while his lungs were screaming and his thought processes were beginning to go fuzzy due to lack of oxygen.<br><br>Get some air. Then go after those puppies. If he was still alive after that, maybe God would give him some inspiration.<br><br>When Murphy walked into the lab, he was greeted by the sight of a young woman bent over a workbench, her jet-black hair, tied back in a ponytail, making a stark contrast with her crisp white lab coat as she scrutinized a sheet of parchment. She didn&#x2019;t look up as the door clicked shut behind him, and he stood for a moment, smiling at the expression of fierce concentration on her face.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you grinning at, Professor?&#x201d; she asked, her eyes never leaving the parchment.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing, Shari. Nothing at all. It&#x2019;s just nice to see someone so absorbed in their work, is all.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave a short &#x201c;hmph,&#x201d; still not looking up, and Murphy&#x2019;s smile broadened. Shari Nelson was one of the top students in his biblical archaeology class at Preston University, and for almost two years she had been his part-time research assistant. In that time he&#x2019;d come to appreciate her passion for the subject, her limitless capacity for hard work, and her sharp intelligence. But most of all, he valued her warm and generous spirit. She might be pretending to ignore him right now, but they&#x2019;d been through enough tragedy and heartache together in the past year, with the deaths of his wife and her brother still painful every hour of every day, for him to know that she would drop everything&#x2013;even a fascinating ancient parchment like the one she was studying&#x2013;if he needed her.<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s up, Shari? Did the results from the carbon-dating tests on our little pottery fragment come in?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Shari replied, returning the parchment to the clear plastic container on the bench. &#x201c;But something has definitely arrived for you.&#x201d; She gestured toward a large white envelope with the purple and orange lettering of Federal Express.<br><br>Shari watched eagerly as Murphy picked up the package. Clearly she&#x2019;d had a hard time containing her curiosity while she waited for Murphy to arrive at the lab. <br><br>&#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;No return address. Just Babylon. Doesn&#x2019;t look like it went through the usual FedEx mailing process.&#x201d; He heard Shari gasp. Babylon, she knew all too well, could only mean one thing: a whole heap of trouble. <br><br>Murphy carefully opened the envelope and shook the contents&#x2013;a smaller envelope with the words Professor Murphy printed in heavy marker and a xeroxed page from a map&#x2013;out onto the workbench. He glanced at the map, then opened the second envelope. Inside was an index card with three words typed on it.<br><br>Chemar. Zepheth. Kopher.<br><br>He handed it to Shari while he examined the map. A route had been marked in pink felt-tip from Raleigh, moving west, across the border into Tennessee. Where the snaking line stopped, there were an X and four barely legible words written in a spidery scrawl:<br><br>&#x201c;Cave of the Waters. Mean anything to you, Shari?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It sounds like somewhere you definitely don&#x2019;t want to go,&#x201d; she replied firmly.<br>He winced. Exactly what Laura would have said. Same tone of voice, even.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming back to me. I&#x2019;ve heard of this place. It&#x2019;s in the Great Smoky Mountains . . . past Asheville, somewhere between Waynesville and Bryson City.&#x201d; If he remembered it right, the cave was discovered in the early 1900s but had never been fully explored, because the high water table in the area&#x2013;not to mention at least three underground streams that ran through it&#x2013;caused the chambers to flood periodically. It was supposed to contain a vast labyrinth of passageways, but no one knew how far they extended. Caving expeditions had been officially discouraged after three cavers were lost without a trace in the early seventies.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, so we&#x2019;ve got directions to a cave. Now, what about the message on the card? What do you make of it, Shari?&#x201d;<br><br>She repeated the words. &#x201c;Chemar. Zepheth. Kopher. It&#x2019;s Hebrew. No problem there. But beyond that it&#x2019;s got me stumped. Does it have something to do with Babylon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me,&#x201d; he said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. &#x201c;But right now it doesn&#x2019;t mean any more to me than it does to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no signature anywhere, and no return address. So how can we find out who sent this?&#x201d;<br>Murphy gave a half-smile. &#x201c;Come on, Shari. A mysterious message in an ancient language? A set of directions to a remote spot? Babylon? He didn&#x2019;t really need to sign it, did he?&#x201d;<br><br>Shari sighed. &#x201c;I guess not. I was just hoping . . . you know, that it might be something else. Something innocent. Not one of these crazy games where you&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>She could tell Murphy wasn&#x2019;t listening anymore. He was studying the map intently, already halfway there. Her heart sank as she realized there was nothing she could do to stop him. <br><br>All she could do now was pray.</p><h2>Destruction And Reconstruction</h2><p>In this unique series, the Civil War comes vividly to life, as those who were there give eye-witness accounts from both sides of the bloody conflict.

S. Byatt, Times Literary Supplement Inspired by a series of instructive letters written by Austen to a novel-writing niece, Letters to Alice is an epistolary novel in which an important modern writer responds to her niece&#39;s complaint that Jane Austen is boring and irrelevant. By turns passionate and ironic, &#34;Aunt Fay&#34; makes Alice think - not only about books and literature, but also life and culture. &#34;A study of a writer (and reader) thinking aloud about art and civilization . . . it should be required reading, a prerequisite for students of literature.&#34; - Hilma Wolitzer, New York Times Book Review</p><p>YA In this "epistolary novel," Weldon, like Jane Austen, writes letters to a niece (in Weldon's case, imaginary) about literature and writing. In addition, "Aunt" Fay writes about the life and works of Jane Austen and about her own thoughts concerning Austen and the times in which she lived. Through her letters, readers find Alice struggling with her own novel; unhappy at school, where she must read Austen; quarreling with parents; having a love affair; and living a modern life with her green spiky hair. Those who especially enjoy Austen and/or those interested in writing and in literature will find this book well-written, intruiging and witty. A special book for a limited audience.

Ikeda is a leading Buddhist, author and educator and is deeply rooted in the Mahayana Buddhism of Nichiren. Galtung is the founder of the Institute for Peace Research in Oslo and has developed a more general Buddhist orientation. Together, through dialogue, they search for ways of interfacing Buddhism and peace. Presented as a dialogue between the two men, Choose Peace explores practical solutions to many of the global problems afflicting the world today. Galtung and Ikeda identify sources of violence and unrest and consider the role of Buddhism in formulating peaceful solutions to violence. The implications of political forces such as nationalism and socialism are considered and the role of human rights, grassroots power and the United Nations in peacekeeping initiatives are explored.</p><p>Johan Galtung founded the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo in 1959 and is the author of many essays and works on peace. Currently Professor of Peace Studies at six universities, he is the holder of the Right Livelihood Award 1987 and the Norwegian Humanist Prize 1988. Daisaku Ikeda is a leading figure in the international Buddhist movement, president of the Buddhist lay organisation Soka Gakkai International (SGI)and founder of the Institute of Oriental Philosophy and Soka University. His publications include Choose Life: A Dialogue with Arnold Toynbee (Oxford University Press, 1976)&#39;The present dialogue betwen these two eminent thinkers is fascinating and often profound, covering a broad spectrum of intellectual moral and spiritual issues. The dialogue is itself an illustration in miniature of what Ikeda means by &#39;diverse cultures coexisting in a symbiotic state of mutual respect&#39;, which he hopes will become symbolic of the 21st century.

Pitted against Zaldore and her group seeking to manipulate the convelescing Ranger known as Longeye to foil the Queen and rule the world, Altimere dares to utilize the untested powers of half-human, half-Fey Rebecca Beauvally, recognized by the elemental denizens of the Vaitura as The Gardener.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all plans must be rewritten: Becca breaks Altimere's capricious dominion with the dangerous herbal help of Duainfey, but, weakened by the effort, is held against her will in service to the Queen by Meripen's mysterious sea-lord cousin, Sian.

With the magics of the Vaitura, and Altimere's retribution arrayed against her, she escapes with only her horse, a mad forest-living Brethren, and her freed magical servant Nancy at her side. Worse, the recovered legendary hero Longeye, long beloved of the Vaitura's forest folk and creatures, has re-armed at Sian's bidding, and knows most of all about Becca that she is both dangerous, and of the same folk who cruelly tortured him and slew his lover before his eyes.</p><p>Sharon Lee and Steve Miller<b> </b>live in the rolling hills of Central Maine with two insistent muses in the form of cats and a large cast of characters.

She lives in New York City.Essayist and journalist Gornick (Fierce Attachments, 1987; The Approaching Eye, 1996) gathers under one cover 11 essays that explore the meaning of love and marriage as literary themes in the 20th century. Gornick writes in a pithy, intensely concentrated literary style that is individual, uncannily precise, and a pleasure to read. Consider her comments on Grace Paley's prose: ``These sentences are born of a concentration in the writer that runs so deep, is turned so far inward, it achieves the lucidity of the poet. . . . The material is at one with the voice speaking.'' This is true of Gornick's own prose. She has the extraordinary ability to cut to the bone of our common experience with just a few, well-chosen words. What makes her work unusual for a book of this sort is that she persuades by the power of her language--gracefully poised between objective knowledge and subjective experience--more than by discursive argument. Her governing idea is this: Love, sexual fulfillment, and marriage are now exhausted as the metaphorical expressions of success and happiness. Modern experience cannot bear out these traditional meanings. It's not that people can no longer fall in love and be happily married. But the traditional scenario of love and marriage in the age of divorce and contraception ``cannot provide insight, it can only repeat a view of things that today feels sadly tired and without the power to make one see anew.'' Gornick's subtle ear and mind illuminate works by Paley, Willa Cather, George Meredith, Kate Chopin, Jean Rhys, Raymond Carver, Andre Dubus, Jane Smiley, Richard Ford, Christina Stead, and Radclyffe Hall. Not all familiar names, but Gornick makes you want to read the ones you don't know and reread the ones you do. An exceptionally well-written, original, and thought-provoking set of essays. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is the author of the phenomenally successful Island, Dive and Everest trilogies, the ever-popular Macdonald Hall series and the popular On the Run series. Korman likes to travel and visit students all over North America.Grade 7-10 This zany, but rather pointless, romp pits Simon Irving against his father, vice-president of Interflux corporation, to save a piece of open land next to his high school. While masquerading as contemporary high-school angst, this novel is pure fantasy bordering on the ridiculous at points. Although there are some funny moments at school and passable character development of Simon and his two best friends, girls and women are reduced to cardboard stupidity or, worse yet, clinging boyfriend fiends. Simon's mother is a culinary fool who follows every whimsical new "health" diet that the newspaper prints. She is the continual target of the longest standing joke in the book. The ending, true to form, depends on the absurd antics of another adult, this time Simon's father's boss, to resolve the dilemma of students fighting the insensitive corporation. Thus, the story ends even more pointlessly than it began. It's easy to pass this one by.

In the thousand-sun network of humanity&#39;s expansion, new colony worlds are struggling to find their way. Every new planet lives on a knife edge between collapse and wonder, and the crew of the aging gunship Rocinante have their hands more than full keeping the fragile peace. In the vast space between Earth and Jupiter, the inner planets and belt have formed a tentative and uncertain alliance still haunted by a history of wars and prejudices. On the lost colony world of Laconia, a hidden enemy has a new vision for all of humanity and the power to enforce it. New technologies clash with old as the history of human conflict returns to its ancient patterns of war and subjugation. But human nature is not the only enemy, and the forces being unleashed have their own price. A price that will change the shape of humanity -- and of the Rocinante -- unexpectedly and forever... Persepolis Rising is a breakneck science fiction adventure following the bestselling Babylon&#39;s Ashes.</p><p></p><h2>The Crucified Jew: Twenty Centuries of Christian Anti-Semitism</h2><p>The author finds the roots of modern anti-Semitism in Christianity itself. The followers of Christ believed themselves to be the true heirs of the covenant with God that the Jews had rejected. Even their scriptures - the New Testament - express a deep distrust of the tradition into which Christ himself was born. As the centuries unfold in a grim and unrelenting chronicle, the Jewish people are vilified for their role in Jesus&#39; death and for rejecting him as their saviour. They are caricatured as a dark force seeking to undermine Chritianity, whether by political or supernatural means. The book concludes with a study of anti-Semitism in post-war Europe, where the church has at last made some attempt to repent for past sins, and to open a meaningful exchange with its Jewish brothers and sisters. The author argues that this initiative is vital.</p><p>Dan Cohn-Sherbok teaches Jewish theology at the University of Kent, Canterbury, England, and is a visiting professor of Judaism at the University of Wales, Lampeter, and of interfaith dialogue at the University of Middlesex.With such a piercing title, Cohn-Sherbok (theology, Univ. of Kent; Jewish Mysticism, LJ 4/1/96) emphatically frames his lengthy monolog, chiefly focusing on the Christian roots of historical and institutional anti-Semitism. Such bigotry is a constant in historical Christendom: "Anti-Jewish attitudes in the history of the Church were not accidental?rather they were the direct consequence of Christian teaching about Judaism and the Jewish nation." Cohn-Sherbok excels at describing the effects of anti-Semitism both on the Jewish community and the historical Judaic psyche. His grasp of history is far-ranging. However, depth and critical analysis are wanting, rendering many of his conclusions more mechanical and polemical than engaging. Imprecision of language weakens his text; he utilizes "Christian" where perhaps "New Testament" or "institutional Church" might be apropos. Issues of historical context are too often not raised.

He reaches a decision that forces an assessment of his choice of life, of his marriage and ultimately of his values and worth in modern society. It is a universal story of a man lost in a world that no longer recognizes either him or his talent.</p><p>Dag Solstad is one of Norway&#39;s leading contemporary authors. His work has consistently won critical acclaim and he is the only author to have received the Norwegian Literary Critics&#39; Award three times. All three of his novels available in English have been listed for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize: Shyness and Dignity was shortlisted in 2007 and Novel 11, Book 18 and Professor Andersen&#39;s Night were longlisted for the 2009 and 2012 prizes respectively.An Oslo academic who came of age in the way-out '60s shrinks back from the glaring modern age in Norwegian novelist and playwright Solstad's remarkably nuanced novel, his first to be translated into English. Elias Rukla, described in this stiff translation as "a rather sottish senior master in his fifties with a wife who had spread out a bit too much," is fed up after 25 years of teaching Ibsen's <i>Wild Duck</i> to increasingly apathetic 19-year-olds at Oslo's Fagerborg Secondary School. A breakdown following an incident with an umbrella and verbally abusing a student makes Elias recognize he has become obsolete. Accompanied by rueful thoughts of his aging but once beautiful wife, Eva Linde, the drama of Elias's life unfolds, from the memory of his friendship with Eva's first husband, the intellectual dynamo and Marxist Johan Corneliussen. Inseparable mates at university, the men engaged in vigorous discussions about philosophy and literature that stretched over days and numerous parties. But Johan inexplicably left for New York to join the capitalist quagmire he always railed against, abandoning Eva and their young child, a betrayal from which Elias never recovers. With sublime restraint and subtle modulation, Solstad conveys an entire age of sorrow and loss. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Forsman tells their story through each character&#x2019;s perspective, jumping between points of view with each chapter. But quickly, this somewhat familiar teenage experience takes a more nihilistic turn as James&#x2019;s character exhibits a rapidly forming sociopathy that threatens both of their futures. He harbors violent fantasies and begins to act on them, while Alyssa remains as willfully ignorant for as long as she can, blinded by young love. Forsman&#x2019;s story highlights the disdain, fear and existential search that many teenagers fear, but through a road trip drama that owes as much to <em>Badlands</em> as <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>. Forsman&#x2019;s inviting, Charles Schulz-influenced style lends a deadpan quality that underscores the narrative&#x2019;s tension. <em>The End of the Fucking World</em> is certain to be one of the most talked-about graphic novels of 2013. Forsman is arguably the most acclaimed talent to come out of the Center for Cartoon Studies, a school founded in 2004 by graphic novelist James Sturm and educator Michelle Ollie in White River Junction, VT. Forsman graduated in 2008 and is a two-time Ignatz Award-winner for his self-published minicomic, <em>Snake Oil</em>. <em>The End of the Fucking World</em> is his first graphic novel. Black &amp; white illustrations throughout</p><p>Charles Forsman's The End of the F***ing World&nbsp;graphic novel has been adapted into a&nbsp; critically acclaimed television series that is distributed by Netflix. He is also a graduate of the Center for Cartoon Studies. He lives in Hancock, Mass.&#34;When I was thirteen and a half, I found a cat in the woods. I smashed its body with a stone.&#34; Like a teenage metal head&#39;s revenge fantasy world spun out of control, but drawn by a demented Mort Walker, this debut graphic novel is a haunting odyssey. James is an unfeeling and disturbed youth who tortures animals, sticks his hand down a garbage disposal, punches his father in the face, and lacks compassion or feeling for anyone else. At 16, he pretends to fall in love with his classmate Alyssa and convinces her to split town with him after he steals his dad&#39;s car. They break into a house in the suburbs and start playing a clumsy version of house, unable to escape the awkwardness of their age. They also make a disturbing discovery about the homeowner. When he returns, the pair&#39;s fake home life comes crashing down. This is a visceral comic, full of deeply unsettling violent images and actions, though Forsman&#39;s minimalist style helps keep the focus on the impact of the events, not the horror itself. This is not a redemption story, and there are no good people in it. Forsman has crafted a comic that captures youth, frustration, and that deep, dark feeling that maybe things won&#39;t get better when you get older.

His meandering and anecdotal work attempts to cover a great deal of material in a very slim volume. While the illustrations are quite wonderful and the text is readable, a great deal of important information is left out. The modern practice of wicca, a necessary part of discussions of witchcraft, is given a very small treatment. Moreover, the thesis wanders away from witchcraft into other occult practices without clarifying differences. For example, the Order of the Golden Dawn and the sensational life of Aleister Crowley are given some attention without distinguishing ceremonial magic from witchcraft or explaining the role of sex magic. This work will infuriate scholars and practitioners in equal measure.

It was a vision of a place where children and parents could have fun together. After numerous visits to Los Angeles' Griffith Park with his daughters, Diane and Sharon, Walt Disney dreamed of opening an amusement park with attractions that could entertain the whole family. Disney originally envisioned utilizing the 8-acre space adjacent to his studios in Burbank; however, he soon realized the space would not be vast enough to house his creative plans. Walt hired a consultant to find the appropriate venue for his proposed project and ultimately purchased a 160-acre tract of orange groves in Anaheim, poaching the best talent from his studios to breathe life into his vision. Thus, the "Happiest Place on Earth" was born. <p></p>Today, Disney Parks can be found all around the world, but Disneyland, the only park created entirely under Walt's supervision, remains the cornerstone of America's theme parks and the second most visited theme park in the world. <p></p>Capturing the Magic celebrates the wonder of the Disneyland Park, Walt Disney's magical lands where stories, fantasy, and enchantment.

But there are darker places than any shadow, as Larry learns the hard way when he is taken hostage by a psychotic gunman who forces Larry to be his chauffer on a road trip destined to end in disaster... unless Larry can muster the courage to act. The return of Paul Chadwick&#39;s award-winning Concrete has ushered in a resurgence of interest in the acclaimed series, and Killer Smile is Chadwick&#39;s darkest Concrete work, a harrowing tale Frank Miller called &#34;edge-of-your-seat suspense, full of unpredictable twists and turns.&#34; This value-priced volume collects Killer Smile plus bonus short stories.</p><p><b>Paul Chadwick </b>is a writer, artist, and creator of the popular comic book <i>Concrete. </i>Chadwick was educated at the ArtCenter College of Design and soon after began storyboarding for film and television. He is known for his work on <i>Another Chance to Get it Right, Concrete, Eerie, Y: The Last Man</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>and <i>Dark Horse Presents.&nbsp;</i>Chadwick's stories about a tenderhearted guy whose intelligence has been put in a huge, granitelike body with heightened strength and senses are usually quiet dramas that belie superhero conventions by focusing on Concrete's undemonstrative use of his powers to make a small difference. <i>Killer </i>Smile departs from that norm. It's a fast-paced nail-biter in which Concrete takes a backseat, while a psychopathic gunman and his troubled girlfriend take Larry Munro, Concrete's personal assistant, hostage. Tension builds as mild-mannered Larry wonders whether he'll have the courage to act should opportunity arise, and Concrete helplessly stands by as police get in a standoff with Larry's captors. Chadwick's hyperdetailed drawings and cinematic, though text-heavy, storytelling make the suspense tangible right up to the emotionally fraught climax, in which Concrete's fearsome demeanor and persuasive powers prove more useful than his strength and invulnerability. Short stories in which Concrete retreats to the desert to write, attends a Halloween party, and shares Christmas with Larry's family, and 13 horror vignettes sans Concrete, round out the volume. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

After personally working with over 11,000 trauma survivors, including the survivors of Oklahoma City Bombing and September 11th, he details the impact of such trauma in our lives and offers resources for healing these breaches in our individual and collective consciousness. Stress and trauma cause an automatic protective reaction within us that pauses our &#34;quantum&#34; perception until we are ready to deal with such experiences. Intense feelings of shame, fear, anger, sadness, and even physical pain are frequently indicators that, within the ninety-three percent subconscious mind, we are still present in a scene of pain that has yet to be fully resolved. Through an emotional reframing process that Brent Baum has developed over the last fifteen years, we can learn to send our own corrective signal to the subconscious mind, indicating that we now possess the resources to free ourselves from the images and patterns of the past. This enables us to return to living fully in the present where authentic intimacy, serenity, and abundance are to be found.</p><p>Brent Baum is an interdisciplinarian who has served as a Catholic priest, an archaeologist in the Middle East for over 13 years, as an addictions counselor and psychotherapist, and is certified clinical hypnotherapist. He developed his approach to trauma resolution in response to his frustration with the ineffectiveness of traditional trauma resolution approaches and has successfully worked with over 11,000 trauma survivors, in part, as clinical director of a nationally recognized treatment center that specialized in trauma resolution. He is currently in private practice in Tucson, AZ, and is one of a select group of independent contractors offering workshops and therapy services at &#34;Miraval: Life in Balance,&#34; ranked as the nation&#39;s leading alternative healing resort/spa. He travels throughout the world, teaching his trauma resolution techniques and offers healing retreats and workshops. Professionals and clients herald his approach as a breackthrough in trauma resolution, due to both its empowerment of the &#34;healer within&#34; us, and its efficiency in the resolution of the symptoms of profound trauma.</p><h2>Raising Boys: Why Boys Are Different - And How to Help Them Become Happy and Well-Balanced Men</h2><p><b>A friendly and practical guide to the stages and issues in boys'�? development from birth to manhood.</b><br><br>From award-winning psychologist Steve Biddulph comes an expanded and updated edition of RAISING BOYS, his international best seller published in 14 countries.

The waters seem frigid, the high, sweeping winds intolerable, and the seas rolling. Yet to seabirds of the northern hemisphere, these waters are idyllic, a mosaic of habitats teeming with underwater food and alive with currents of wind for soaring. Join Sophie Webb on a voyage in search of seabirds. Just as she did with her award-winning My Season with Penguins, she once again inspires our curiosity. As she watches for, writes about, and paints the graceful mottled petrel, the huge black-footed albatross, or the clownish tufted puffin, she makes tangible the delicacy yet hardiness of these seabirds&#x2014;creatures that have been on the earth much longer than humans yet remain vulnerable to disturbances in the health of the ocean.</p><p>Sophie Webb is often at sea. Research ships have taken her to many shores, including those of Hawaii, Mexico, Central and South America, Alaska, and the Antarctic. Her ornithological illustrations appear in A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America, of which she is co-author. She lives in Bolinas, California.Gr. 4-6. The natural history diarist who earned a Sibert Honor for <i>My Season with Penguins: An Antarctic Journal</i> (2000) now invites readers to join her aboard the <i>Alpha Helix</i>, a research vessel, on a month-long expedition to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. She is there to count seabirds, whose population density can help researchers gauge the ocean's health. The birds involved here probably won't garner the same instant enthusiasm among young children as waddling, tuxedoed penguins, and Webb's shipboard vantage point precludes the hands-on interactions that enlivened her first book. However, the text and accompanying watercolors are just as brimming with gritty details (it's wise not to serve spherical foods on a boat, because they roll off the plate), and children will feel Webb's delight in the moments that make the rigors of field research worth it: a glimpse of Crested Auklets "like something out of Dr. Seuss' imagination" or an albatross that commutes from Hawaii to Alaska to collect food, then backtracks 5,600 miles to nourish its waiting chicks. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The choice of poems reflects the great variety of light verse as well as the tastes and views of its distinguished editor. The selections range from genial satire to nonsense verse, from epigrams to limericks. More than 250 poems by some 80 authors provide a witty and consistently entertaining survey of English verse from Rochester and Ben Jonson to Anthony Powell and Philip Larkin.<br> As Mr. Amis explains in a lively introduction, the principles on which he based this selection differ from those used by W.H. Auden in selecting for <em>The Oxford Book of Light Verse</em> (first published in 1938). Auden's definition of "light" was closer to "popular" than "humorous." Amis's collection--which includes familiar favorites as well as previously unpublished masterpieces--is lighter in heart, closer to a modern understanding of the meaning of "light."</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>Kingsley Amis</strong> is the author of 18 novels, including <em>Lucky Jim</em> and <em>The Old Devils</em>, which was awarded the 1986 Booker Prize, as well as numerous books of criticism and verse.<br>`rich in exhilarating pleasures' Sunday Times<br><br>`extremely funny and absorbing...a reflection, of course, of the sureness of Amis's taste' Jeremy Treglown, Books and Bookmen<br><br>`casts his net wide, scooping up some very funny fish indeed...more than 300 pages of sheer delight'<br>Sunday Telegraph<br><br>`very comprehensive and enjoyable' Gavin Ewart, Observer<br><br>`Full of good stuff.'

No one who knew this well-liked, generous man could make sense of his sudden disappearance one autumn night. On a final phone call to his brother from his Mercedes, Jerry breathed a muffled oath -- then the line went dead. For Jerry's wife, Susan, it was just the beginning of an unwavering, eight-year search for the truth behind her husband's vanishing. Through exclusive access to an FBI agent inside the investigation, Ann Rule unmasks a man driven by malevolence and hidden jealousy to destroy Jerry Harris' magnificent business empire. She expertly profiles a criminal mind that stopped at nothing in a scheme of greed and violence. With the riveting power of a Greek tragedy, Rule reveals the dark underside of an all-American success story, and a wife's ultimate triumph of justice in the name of love. Including other unforgettable accounts of true crime, this is Ann Rule at her chilling best.</p><p>Ann Rule is a former Seattle policewoman and the author of more than two dozen New York Times bestsellers.

In nearly 2,000 pages and 4,000 signed entries, this single volume captures the impressive complexity of New York State as a historic crossroads of people and ideas, as a cradle of abolitionism and feminism, and as an apex of modern urban, suburban, and rural life. The Encyclopedia is packed with fascinating details from fields ranging from sociology and geography to history. Did you know that Manhattan's Lower East Side was once the most populated neighborhood in the world, but Hamilton County in the Adirondacks is the least densely populated county east of the Mississippi; New York is the only state to border both the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean; the Erie Canal opened New York City to rich farmland upstate . . . and to the west. Entries by experts chronicle New York's varied areas, politics, and persuasions with a cornucopia of subjects from environmentalism to higher education to railroads, weaving the state's diverse regions and peoples into one idea of New York State. <br><br>Lavishly illustrated with 500 photographs and figures, 120 maps, and 140 tables, the Encyclopedia is key to understanding the state's past, present, and future. It is a crucial reference for students, teachers, historians, and business people, for New Yorkers of all persuasions, and for anyone interested in finding out more about New York State.</p><p>Peter Eisenstadt served as managing editor of The Encyclopedia of New York City and is the author of several works on New York State history. Laura-Eve Moss specializes in the political and constitutional history of New York State, and she is currently an editor of The Papers of Andrew Jackson.*Starred Review* Seven years from idea to fruition and supported with major grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the New York State Legislature, this volume from Syracuse University Press is a major reference source for the study of the Empire State. Editor Eisenstadt served as managing editor of <i>The Encyclopedia of New York City</i> (Yale, 1995), which was used as a model for this new volume. Eisenstadt and coeditor Moss worked with a notable advisory board that included author William Kennedy, New York senator Charles Schumer, and Wendell Tripp, former director of publications for the NYS Historical Association and more recently the mayor of Cooperstown, N.Y. The 1,200 contributors (listed with short biographies) are a diverse group--from county and town historians to museum personnel, journalists, and college professors. <p>The alphabetically arranged entries include all cities, towns, and counties (more than 1,500), with an additional 3,000-plus entries for information on a wide range of topics--<i>Bigfoot, Capital punishment, Corning Inc., Drumlins, General Electric Global Research Center, Hops, Resort hotels, Telegraph industry,</i> and <i>Thousand Island dressing,</i> to name a few. Lewis Waterman, the inventor of the fountain pen; composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein; baseball player Lou Gehrig; former governor of New York Mario Cuomo; folksinger Pete Seeger; and speed skater Jack Shea are just a sampling of the subjects of biographical entries. Although 40 percent of the population of the state lives in metropolitan New York City, "upstate" is equally represented. Some topics, such as <i>Literature,</i> have an article on the New York City area and a separate article for "beyond New York City." Exemplifying the depth and detail of the articles are the five pages devoted to the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center--the cultural and institutional responses, reconstruction, and repercussions. Shorter but still excellent articles discuss <i>Musical theater</i> and the <i>Holland Land Company.</i> These and many other longer and shorter articles end with a bibliography.</p><p>The contributors and editors have done an excellent job in relating all the subjects to their significance to New York. There is a specificity and depth to the writing that is not often found in a subject encyclopedia. The index is an excellent finding aid for subjects that do not have an entry. <i>See</i> references are also helpful.</p><p>The maps and illustrations are all black and white and include a number of grainy photographs. Tables and boxes cover such diverse topics as professional baseball teams in the state from 1871; gubernatorial elections from 1824; the railroad network of 1865, 1885, and 2000; education in New York City; and Bosnians in Utica. </p><p>This ambitious project is a definite success. Free copies have been provided to all public libraries in the state, and there is a discount for state school libraries. The encyclopedia is also recommended for academic and large public libraries in contiguous states and any library that has former or prospective New Yorkers. <i>Christine Bulson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The Greatest Horse Stories Every Told gathers the most memorable essays, articles, short fiction, and poetry ever written about the bond between humans and horses.

Jeff Shanley takes over his family's locally revered construction firm and realizes that the only way to deliver on the two biggest projects in the company's history is to rapidly build a culture of hiring and development around those virtues.To do that, he'll have to confront and risk losing talented employees who don't know how to work on a team, and convince his fiery VP of operations not to lower the company's hiring standards in the face of short-term business pressure. </p><p>Beyond the fable, Lencioni presents a powerful framework and easy-to-use tools for identifying, hiring, and developing ideal team players in any kind of organization.Whether you're a leader striving to create a culture of teamwork, a human resources professional looking to hire real team players, or an employee wanting to make yourself an invaluable team member, <i>The Ideal Team Player</i> will prove </p><p>to be as practical as it is compelling.</p><p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Ideal Team Player</i></b></p><b> </b><p><b></b>"No business author alive today packs more wisdom per page than Patrick Lencioni.

Smith</strong> is a former Navy man and police officer who went to work for the FBI during the height of the Watergate investigations and ended his career more than twenty-five years later during the Whitewater investigation. Both an expert in counterintelligence and government corruption investigations, Smith was involved in numerous high profile cases including the Larry Wu Tai Chin espionage and Katrina Leung cases and has unique insights into such cases as the Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen investigations. He served overseas as a legal attach� for the South Pacific, based in Canberra, Australia, and spent a year at the Department of State where he traveled to the Soviet Union, Nicaragua, and China while conducting counterintelligence threat surveys. As special agent in charge in Arkansas, Smith became intimately involved in the campaign finance investigations during the Clinton administration and initiated a top-down investigation of corruption in the political machine that produced a president of the United States. Those investigations became national news, and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> called Smith a "storied figure" in the FBI. Smith, since his retirement in July 1998, has been a frequent commentator on national security issues in the national media and has lectured at the Smithsonian Institution. From a street agent in St. Louis, Missouri, to a member of the FBI's elite Senior Executive Service, Smith's career encompassed some of the FBI's greatest accomplishments and most visible failures, and he tells those stories with unusual candor as only one on the inside can.</p><h2>The Little Red Hen</h2><p>The Little Red Hen</p><p></p><h2>Ray &amp; Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away</h2><p>This fall, the movie The Founder will focus the spotlight on Ray Kroc, who amassed a fortune as the chairman of McDonalds.

Among the more than 1,700 entries are <i>Dogen Kigan, Filial piety,</i> and <i>Shikhin Buddha.</i> Much of the content consists of short, dictionary-type definitions, although some (for example, <i>Bodhisattva precepts, Buddha, Pilgrimage</i>) are more expansive. The illustrations are all black and white, occur on approximately one-quarter of the pages, and usually cover less than half a page. The entries include extensive cross-references, and the "Contents by Subject" at the beginning of the encyclopedia aids the reader in locating thematically related entries. The coverage of the subject areas is good.<p>The encyclopedia could have been greatly improved with the inclusion of glossaries giving the terms in the various languages involved. A glossary of Sanskrit, Chinese characters, pinyin and Wade-Giles Chinese transliteration methods, and transliterated Japanese would significantly increase the utility. Although the volume is adequate for the general reader, this conspicuous omission limits its usefulness for the more serious researcher.</p><p>Libraries that already have common religion reference sources, such as Eliade's <i>The Encyclopedia of Religion</i> (Macmillan, 1987), will probably find no reason to add this new encyclopedia to their collections. Some other subject encyclopedias may also be more useful. For example, <i>Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia</i> (Kodansha, 1993) includes the Chinese characters with Japanese transliterations along with far superior illustrations and gives good coverage of religious themes. However, academic libraries supporting large religious studies departments may want to buy The Ilustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism for the added coverage. Public libraries that have no other resources on Zen Buddhism might also consider it. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Translated by Theodora Vasils and Themi Vasils.<br><br> The familiar figures who peopled that ancient world -- King Minos, Theseus and Ariadne, the Minotaur, Diadalos and Ikaros -- fill the pages of this novel with lifelike immediacy.<br><br> Written originally for an Athenian youth periodical, <i>At the Palaces of Knossos</i> functions on several levels. Fundamentally, it is a gripping and vivid adventure story, recounted by one of this century's greatest storytellers, and peopled with freshly interpreted figures of classical Greek mythology. We see a new vision of the Minotaur, portrayed here as a bloated and sickly green monster, as much to be pitied as dreaded. And we see a grief-stricken and embittered Diadalos stomping on the homemade wax wings that have caused the drowning of his son, Ikaros.<br><br> On another level, <i>At the Palaces of Knossos</i> is an allegory of history, showing the supplanting of a primitive culture by a more modern civilization. Shifting the setting back and forth from Crete to Athens, Kazantzakis contrasts the languid, decaying life of the court of King Minos with the youth and vigor of the newly emerging Athens.<br><br> Protected by bronze swords, by ancient magic and ritual, and by ferocious-but-no-longer-invincible monsters, the kingdom of Crete represents the world that must perish if classical Greek civilization is to emerge into its golden age of reason and science. In the cataclysmic final scene in which the Minotaur is killed and King Minos's sumptuous palace burned, Kazantzakis dramatizes the death of the Bronze Age, with its monsters and totems, and the birth of the Age of Iron.</p><p><b>Theodora Vasils</b> has translated several works by Nikos Kazantzakis. Among her other translated works are short stories published in various literary journals, and a book of poetry, In Another Light, by Koralia Theotokas.<br><br><b>Themi Vasils</b>, along with Theodora Vasils, has translated several works by Nikos Kazantzakis, among them Alexander the Great as well as books by other contemporary Greek writers. Their work has won high praise from Kazantzakis's widow, who comments, &#x201c;Never has Kazantzakis found better translators.&#x201d;Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Doctor Who: The Shooting Scripts</h2><p>This book collects together the entire shooting scripts for the first series. Seven of the scripts are by Russell T. Davies, with the remainder by Steven Moffat, Robert Shearman, Paul Cornell and The League of Gentlemen&#39;s Mark Gatiss.

We expected to be there for three or four months. We ended up staying in Japan and Malaysia for nearly four years. We traveled frequently in China, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, and the Philippines, and we dodged visa rules to get into Burma and Vietnam. One year our children attended Japanese public school, which helped and hurt them in ways we're still hearing about. After our family moved back to Washington, I spent most of another year on reporting trips in Asia.<br><br>Not long ago [July 2006], my wife and I moved to Shanghai for an indefinite stay. You can't do the same thing twice, and we know that this experience will be different. Our children are twenty years older and on their own. We are, well, twenty years older. The last time, everything we saw in Japan and China was new to us. This time, we're looking at Shanghai to compare its skyscrapers and luxury-goods shopping malls with the tile-roofed shop houses and run-down bungalows we first saw here in 1986. The whole experience of expatriation has changed because of the Internet, which allows you to listen to radio programs via Webcast and talk daily with friends and family via Skype.<br><br>But it still means something to be away from the people you know and the scenes and texture of daily home-front life: the newspapers, the movies, the range of products in the stores. (Most of America's ubiquitous "Made in China" merchandise is hard to find in China itself, since it's generally destined straight for export.) And the overall exercise is similar in this way: The Japan of the 1980s was getting a lot of the world's attention; today's China is getting even more. My family and I saw Japan on the way up. During the first few months we were there, the dollar lost one-third of its value against the yen. On each trip to the money-changing office the teller's look seemed to become more pitying, and on each trip to the grocery store (forget about restaurants!) we ratcheted our buying targets another notch downward. The headlines trumpeted the yen's strength and the resulting astronomical valuation of Japan's land, companies, and holdings as signs of the nation's preeminence. The dollar's collapse made us acutely aware of the social bargain that affected everyone in Japan: high domestic prices that penalized consumers, rewarded producers, and subsidized the export success of big Japanese firms.<br><br>China has kept the value of its currency artificially low (as Japan did until 1985, just before we got there), and because it's generally so much poorer than Japan, the daily surprise is how inexpensive, rather than expensive, the basics of life can be. Starbucks coffee shops are widespread and wildly popular in big cities, even though the prices are equivalent to their U.S. levels. But for the same 24 yuan, or just over $3, that a young Shanghai office worker pays for a latte, a construction worker could feed himself for a day or two from the noodle shop likely to be found around the corner from Starbucks. Pizza Hut is also very popular, and is in the "fine dining" category. My wife and I walked into one on a Wednesday evening and were turned away because we hadn't made reservations. Taco Bell Grande is similarly popular and prestigious; the waiters wear enormous joke-like sombreros that would probably lead to lawsuits from the National Council of La Raza if worn in stateside Taco Bells. Kentucky Fried Chicken is less fancy but is a runaway success in China, as it is in most of Asia.<br><br>Through my own experiment in the economics of staple foods, I have been surprised to learn that there is such a thing as beer that is too cheap, at least for my taste. On each of my first few days on scene, I kept discovering an acceptable brand of beer that cost half as much as the beer I'd had the previous day. It was the Shanghai version of Zeno's paradox: The beer became steadily cheaper yet never quite became free. I had an early surprise discovery of imported Sam Adams, for 12 yuan, or $1.50 per 355-ml bottle, which is the regular U.S. size. The next day, I found a bottle of locally brewed Tiger, the national beer of Singapore, for 7 yuan, or 84 cents per 350 ml. Soon I moved to 600-ml "extra value" bottles of Tiger at 6 yuan (72 cents per 600 ml), then Tsingtao at 3.90 yuan (45 cents per 600 ml), then Suntory at 2.90 yuan (35 cents per 600 ml). It was when I hit the watery, sickly sweet Suntory that I knew I'd gone too far. There was one step farther I hesitated to take: a local product called REEB (ha ha!), which I often saw the illegal migrant construction workers swilling, and which was on sale for 2.75 yuan. One night, in a reckless mood, I decided to give REEB a try. It was weaker than the Suntory--_but actually better, because it wasn't as sweet.<br><br>The signs of China's rise are of course apparent everywhere. We can still see many parts of Shanghai that have escaped the building boom of the last two decades--the streets lined with plane trees in the old French Concession district, the men who lounge outside in pajamas or just boxer shorts when the weather is hot. But to see them we have to look past everything that's new, and the latest set of construction cranes or arc-welding teams working through the night to finish yet more projects. From a room in the futuristic Tomorrow Square (!) building where we have been staying, I can look across People's Square to see three huge public video screens that run commercials and music videos seemingly nonstop. The largest screen, nearly two miles away, is the entire side of the thirty-seven-story Aurora building in Pudong, Shanghai's new financial district. In the daytime, the sides of the building are a shiny gold reflective color. At night, they show commercials to much of the town. "People under thirty can't remember anything but a boom," a European banker who has come to Shanghai to expand a credit-card business told me. "It's been fifteen years of double-digit annual expansion. No one anywhere has seen anything like that before."<br><br>My family arrived in Japan just at the beginning of what is widely considered to be its collapse. About the strange nature of that "decline"--one that left Japan richer, and its manufacturing and trading position stronger, than it was during its "boom"--there will be more to say in later reports. But obviously it raises the question: Is this ahead for China? Have we arrived in time to watch another bubble burst? I don't know--no one can--but as a benchmark for later reports, I will mention some of the things that have surprised me in my first few weeks, and I'll do so via lists.<br><br>Numbered lists are popular everywhere--the Ten Commandments, the Four Freedoms--but they seem particularly attractive in this part of the world. When I first arrived in Japan, everyone was talking about the "Three Ks"--the three kinds of work for which the country was quietly tolerating immigrant labor. These were what translated as the "Three Ds": the jobs considered too kitanai (dirty), kiken (dangerous), or kitsui (difficult) to attract native-born workers in modern, rich Japan. During World War II, Japanese forces were notorious for applying a policy of "Three Alls" to occupied China: kill all, burn all, loot all. Memories of that slogan made for hard feelings when a Japanese-owned firm recently tried to register the trademark "Three Alls" (sanguang) in China; because of protests, the application was turned down. In early 2006 the Chinese government put out a widely publicized list of "Eight Honors and Eight Dishonors," or more prosaically "Eight Dos and Don'ts," to express what President Hu Jintao called the "socialist concept of honor and disgrace." For instance: Do strive arduously; don't wallow in luxury. I bought a poster with the full list at the local Xinhua bookstore.<br><br>In a similar constructive spirit, I now offer "Four Cautions and Two Mysteries." These are meant to illustrate what has surprised me so far and what I am most curious about. It is also a partial and preliminary agenda for future inquiry.<br><br>CAUTION ONE: WATCH OUT, JAPANESE PEOPLE!<br><br>To get into a talk with a Japanese intellectual or statesman is sooner or later to ponder the effects of World War II. When will Japan emerge from the war's shadow as a "normal" nation, with a constitution written by its own people (versus the one created by Douglas MacArthur) and with a bona fide army, as opposed to something that has to call itself the "Self-Defense Force"? When will the Chinese and Koreans--_and for that matter the Singaporeans and Filipinos and Australians--_stop mau-mauing Japan with their wartime complaints? What special mission and message does Japan have for the world, as the first and only country to have suffered a nuclear attack? Will Japan's view of America always be skewed into an inferiority/superiority complex because of the U.S. role as conqueror in the war? The process is similar to discussions in Germany--_except that Germans tend to be preemptively apologetic about the problems their forebears caused the world, and Germans make no special claim to suffering like Japan's.<br><br>The process is not at all similar to discussions about the war on this side of the Sea of Japan. I put this item first, because for me it has been the most startling. "Frankly, we hate the Japanese," an undergraduate at a prestigious Chinese university told me in English. The main difference between his comment and what I heard from countless other young people was the word frankly.<br><br>Why should this be surprising, given the centuries of tension between China and Japan? Mainly because of the people who expressed their hostility in the most vehement form: students in their teens and early twenties. They had not been born, nor had their parents (nor even, in many cases, their grandparents), when Japanese troops seized Manchuria in the 1930s, bombed and occupied Shanghai, and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians during the Rape of Nanjing. Wartime memories die hard, but you expect them to be most intense among actual participants or victims, and therefore to fade over time. Israeli teenagers aren't obsessed with today's Germans. I was not able to spend much time at universities talking with students when I was in China in the 1980s, but I don't remember anything comparable to today's level of bile.<br><br>The breadth of hostility surprised me for another reason. For years I have been skeptical of the idea of an anti-Japanese resurgence in China, viewing it as government-manufactured sentiment designed to deflect potential protest toward external enemies and away from the Chinese regime. In a new book called China: Fragile Superpower, Susan Shirk of the University of California at San Diego gives a detailed account of occasions when the Chinese government has deliberately drummed up anti-Japanese sentiment--or damped it down when it seemed to be getting inconveniently robust.<br><br>In a country where media and education are as carefully controlled as they are in China, all public opinion is to an extent manufactured. "The students are excited," a professor at a leading Chinese university told me. "They can be calmed down." Still, I don't view anti-Japanese sentiments as a ploy anymore. "You say anything at all about Japan [on a blog or computer bulletin board], and there will be ten thousand posts immediately," an official of a Chinese high-tech firm told me. "The mob effect can get out of control."<br><br>Partisans of Baidu, the main local search-engine company (which is listed on NASDAQ and has Americans as its main investors) recently ran a blog campaign touting it over Google. One illustration was Google's supposed inability to return any results for searches on "Nanjing Massacre" (or "Nanking," the older Western spelling), whereas Baidu returned plenty. There was a technical reason--Google's servers are outside China and thus must cross the government's "Great Firewall" to send results to users in China. The firewall routinely screens out references to "massacre," as in "Tiananmen Square massacre," and so it blocked Google's results. Baidu's servers and resources are all inside the firewall, and have been pre-scrubbed to remove references to Tiananmen and other prohibited topics. Google has since made adjustments so that it too can report on Nanjing, but the episode showed the sensitivity of the issue.<br><br>The main trigger for renewed Chinese protest against Japan has been the (idiotic) persistence of Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's former prime minister, in paying ceremonial visits to Yasukuni Shrine, in Tokyo, where 14 Class-A war criminals from World War II are among the 2.5 million Japanese war dead the shrine honors. Koizumi recently stepped down after five years in office, but his successor, Shinzo Abe, has refused to rule out continuing the visits. When I've asked Chinese students what they want from Japan, they often say an end to the Yasukuni visits and "an apology." Formal apologies have in fact been offered many times by Japanese officials, and even by the current emperor. If the Chinese are looking for something like German-style ongoing contrition, this is not in the cards. Twentieth-century history, as taught in Japan, holds that Japan itself was the ultimate victim of the "Great Pacific War," because of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br><br>There is one tantalizing further twist to the syndrome. When I have asked young people why they should be so wrapped up with events seventy years in the past, the reply is some variant of: "We Chinese are students of history." There are certain phrases you hear so often that you know they can't be true, at least not at face value. Yes, China's years of subjugation by Western countries and Japan obviously still matter. But the history that is more recent but less often discussed is that of the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, when the parents of today's college students were sent into the countryside and often forced to denounce their own parents. In an eloquent new book called Chinese Lessons, John Pomfret of The Washington Post recounts the ways that his classmates from Nanjing University, where he was an exchange student in the early 1980s, bore the emotional and even moral imprint of those years. They'd been made to do things they knew were wrong, and they found ways to rationalize away that knowledge.

Although less frequently mentioned, these smaller ships gave crucial service during the war and continued to serve decades after VE day, either in the German Navy or in the navies of the victorious Allies. Indeed, Kriegsmarine minesweepers and their German crews, still in their old uniforms with the swastikas simply removed, continued to serve after 1945 under the control of the Royal Navy, engaged in the dangerous but necessary task of clearing old wartime minefields.</p><p>The ships and boats included in the coastal forces ranged from such minesweepers to torpedo boats, patrol boats and blockade breakers. These latter were merchant vessels, whose daunting task was to evade the Allied warships to bring essential supplies into Germany. Also included in the coastal forces was Hitler's personal yacht, the Ostwind. This book tells the often-forgotten story of the vessels that formed the backbone of the Kriegsmarine, and combines fascinating anecdotes, detailed technical information, and full-color artwork.</p></p><p>Gordon Williamson was born in 1951 and currently works for the Scottish Land Register.

The series' heroine, Anna Lee, works for a private-detective firm; her new assignment is to find a missing teenager, Tina Hahn. But the police get to the girl before Anna does. In a catatonic state, Tina is picked up on a London street, and her parents ask Anna to take Tina to a mental hospital. Evidence that Tina has murdered an unidentified man shot in a hotel room demands an investigation that takes Anna into dangerous corners. On her list of people to question are Tina's professors, all of whom remark on the girl's brilliance and impeccable behavior. Clearly she has been leading a double life, and the facts uncovered by the unstoppable sleuth end the story with a double whammy. Cody's fresh, witty style should make her a bestseller. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ayahuasca Reader: Encounters with the Amazon&#39;s Sacred Vine</h2><p><i>The Ayahuasca Reader: Encounters with the Amazon&#x2019;s Sacred Vine</i>, is a panorama of texts translated from nearly a dozen languages on the ayahuasca experience.

Arnold Isaacs, who spent the final years of the war in Vietnam as a correspondent for the Baltimore <i>Sun</i>, describes his firsthand observations of the collapse of Cambodia and South Vietnam -- from the 1973 Paris peace agreement to the American evacuation of Saigon and its aftermath -- with heartbreaking detail, from the devastated battlefields and villages to the boats filled with terrified refugees. He also provides an historical record of unparalleled accuracy and depth about the strategic decisions made during the war's end game and the intelligence failure that led Americans and their Southeast Asian allies to underestimate the strength and perseverance of the enemy. Drawing on previously classified military documents, field reports from American advisors, eyewitness accounts by soldiers and civilians, and North Vietnamese propaganda broadcasts, Isaacs offers a compelling and compassionate portrait of the impact of America's "Vietnamization" of the conflict and a bracing indictment of political and military leaders in the United States and both Vietnams for the massive human suffering that accompanied the end of the war.</p><p>"Vivid and very passionate...

Isaacs's anguished chapter on the collapse of the city of Da Nang, where the first American Marines had landed in 1965, is reason enough to read his fast-paced report." -- John Spragens, Jr., <i>Commonweal</i></p><p>"A sound and interesting narrative, which succeeds in combining vivid images of the war with the statistics and analysis that are essential of historical perspective... A good book." -- <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>"A wonderful weave of Isaacs' eyeball-reporting and subsequent, intense research. The thud and blood of combat in the wailing of mortally wounded nations are here. So are the softer sounds of negotiations, riffled documents, the sigh of broken agreements, and the tinkle of glass on conference tables." -- Paul Dean, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p>"The most complete account of the fall of Indochina... A biting indictment of American policy... The immediacy and impact of his book is compelling." -- <i>Reviews in American History</i></p></p><p><p>Still the best account of the last years of the Vietnam War, written by the author of the acclaimed Vietnam Shadows</p><p>Arnold R.

His tale opens in a hungry winter, when a beached humpback arrives as an unexpected gift and the townspeople convene to claim their piece. From a slit in its gut spills a man--white, mute, and eerily alive--who assumes a central role in the lineage of the Divine family. Alternately feared as a devil and revered as a healer, Judah fathers a fish-scented son with the raven-haired Mary Tryphena. Their family comprises the heart of the town's rich mythology, with all its ghosts, mermaid trysts, strange accidents, miraculous babies, and impossible loves, rendered in language so gorgeously raw, it will transport you to a land whose sky is "alive with the northern lights, the roiling seines of green and red like some eerily silent music to accompany the suffering below." --<i>Mari Malcolm</i>Michael Crummey is the author of a memoir, <b>Newfoundland: Journey into a Lost Nation</b>, three books of poetry, and a book of short stories, <b>Flesh and Blood</b>.

Original.</p><p>*Starred Review* Peter DelaSangre lives in seclusion with his father on an island off the coast of Florida. They have good reason for their isolation: Peter and his father are dragons. Capable of taking human form, they have built a successful business in Florida, run by humans they control but don't trust. Peter and his father feed on humans, but do so stealthily, so as not to draw attention to themselves. But when Peter brings a young woman named Maria to the island in secret and kills her to avoid having her discover that he is a dragon, he draws the suspicion of her brother, Jorge. Peter is distracted, however, by his father's death and the scent of a female dragon who possibly could become his mate. When he at last finds this female dragon, Elizabeth, he fights for her and wins her as his bride. Jorge's relentless search for his sister and the treachery of someone working at Peter's company dog the young couple, and Elizabeth is perplexed by Peter's unwillingness to merely do away with his human enemies. The tension builds as a mysterious further enemy becomes a real threat to the dragons. An exciting, inventive, unique novel with, in Peter, a surprisingly sympathetic protagonist. <i>Kristine Huntley</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The P-40 did not have a turbocharger, but despite this the requirements were constantly increasing, especially when it comes to the maximum speed. It was requested to raise it by over 100 km/h (up to 580 km/h). It required a number of construction changes e.g. new exhaust pipes, new shape and size of the air intake to the carburetor at the top of the engine cover, moving forward the coolers under the nose. After the tests in the NACA wind tunnel it turned out that these changes were not enough. The plane underwent further aerodynamic refinements, using, among others, smooth riveting and retractable tail ring. In the end, the speed was 589 km/h at 4570 m, which gave the green light for serial production.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Is Acupuncture for You?</h2><p>All the info you need on acupuncture.</p><p></p><h2>Ariol #8: The Three Donkeys (Ariol Graphic Novels, 8)</h2><p><p>It's a new volume of ARIOL focusing on the daily life of the little donkey with the big personality.

Writing with a novelist&#x2019;s sensuous evocation of character and detail, and drawing on an erudition that embraces history, politics, and art, Berger follows Picasso from his childhood in Malaga to the Blue Period and Cubism, from the creation of <i>Guernica</i> to the painted etchings of his final years. He gives us the full measure of Picasso&#x2019;s triumphs and unsparing reckoning of their cost&#x2014;in exile, in loneliness, and in a desolation that drove him, in his last works, into an old man&#x2019;s furious and desperate frenzy at the beauty of what he could no longer create.</p><p>At the height of his powers, Pablo Picasso was the artist as revolutionary, breaking through the niceties of form in order to mount a direct challenge to the values of his time. At the height of his fame, he was the artist as royalty: incalculably wealthy, universally idolized--and wholly isolated.In this stunning critical assessment, John Berger--one of this century&#39;s most insightful cultural historians--trains his penetrating gaze upon this most prodigious and enigmatic painter and on the Spanish landscape and very particular culture that shaped his life and work.John Berger was born in London in 1926. He is well known for his novels and stories as well as for his works of nonfiction, including several volumes of art criticism. His first novel, <i>A Painter of Our Time</i>, was published in 1958, and since then his books have included <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, the fiction trilogy <i>Into Their Labours</i>, and the novel <i>G.,</i> which won the Booker Prize in 1972. In 1962 he left Britain permanently, and lived in a small village in the French Alps.

It tells you what Zack Eswine wishes somebody else would&#x2019;ve told him.</p> <p>With over 20 years of experience in ministry, Zack shares with incredible honesty about his own failures, burnout, and pain, all the while addressing the complexities of leadership decisions, church discipline, family dynamics, and so on.</p> <p>Presenting sound pastoral theology couched in autobiographical musings and powerful prose, this book offers a fresh and biblically faithful approach to the care of souls, including your own.</p></p><p><p><strong>Zack Eswine</strong> (PhD, Regent University) is lead pastor at Riverside Church in Webster Groves, Missouri, enjoys writing about life and ministry in Jesus, and blogs at preachingbarefoot.wordpress.com. He is the author of <em>Preaching to a Post-Everything World</em>, which won the PreachingToday.com Preaching Book Award in 2009.</p><p>&#x201c;C. S. Lewis wrote that friendship is born when one man says to another, &#x2018;What! You too? I thought that no one but myself . . . &#x2018; Many pastors will find a new friend in this remarkable book. What makes this book both approachable and powerful is its honesty&#x2014;that rare treasure we pastors are sometimes afraid to make our own. Zack Eswine gives us a front row seat to his heart. In seeing him, we see ourselves. But far better, we also see Jesus in his all-sufficiency for us. To everyone who wants to serve the Lord with a heart set free from pretense, I commend <em>Sensing Jesus</em>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</strong>, Lead Pastor, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;This is one of the finest books on being a pastor written in this generation. I plan to use <em>Sensing Jesus</em> as required read for our pastoral theology students here at Covenant Seminary. The book is heart-wrenchingly honest about Zack&#x2019;s own hopes and dreams and about the challenges of dealing with the praise that is heaped on a gifted young communicator of God&#x2019;s Word. It is this rare honesty that makes the book a must read for anyone called to a life of ministry. Along with this painful and necessary openness, Zack has written not only with a practical helpfulness but also with a kindness of spirit about the follies, sins, and troubles that anyone engaged in serving others is constantly encountering. His careful exposition of Scripture is interwoven with unforgettable stories that bind the points he makes to the hearts of his readers. This will be an outstanding addition to the library of every pastor and teacher, indeed of anyone committed to ministry.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Jerram Barrs</strong><strong>,</strong> Resident Scholar of the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute at Covenant Theological Seminary; author, <em>Freedom and Discipleship</em> and <em>The Heart of Prayer</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book is simultaneously deeply distressing and profoundly comforting. The rhythmic interchange between these two seemingly opposite impacts surprisingly convinced me that this is one of the most helpful books on pastoring that I have read since my ordination in 1978. Ruthless self-address and unvarnished vulnerability are here wed to searching exegesis and an obvious purposed submission to the text of Holy Scripture. . The reader of this work will likely find remaining neutral and numb to their own mediocrity a difficult task!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Joseph V. Novenson</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Pastor, Lookout Mountain Presbyterian Church, Lookout Mountain, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;After marinating in <em>Sensing Jesus</em>, I have two responses&#x2014;one of lament and one of joy. Where was this book when I was stuck in the unrelenting grind of performance-based pastoring; the spiritual schizophrenia of preaching the gospel of grace with a frozen heart; the lonely pedestal of a pulpit surrounded by thousands of people? But joy fills my heart as I realize what a great book I now have with which to mentor young pastors and preachers. Zack, thank you for stewarding your pain and God&#x2019;s gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Scotty Smith</strong><strong>,</strong> Teacher in Residence, West End Community Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p> &#x201c;In prose that is warmly authentic and deeply rooted in the wisdom of Scripture and a life well examined, Zack Eswine invites those who minister to pause and reflect. Eswine unfolds a lovely biblical vision of ministry that embraces the localities, limits, physicality, and margins of our finiteness that God deems good. Devotional, rich in insight, gentle in teaching, <em>Sensing Jesus</em> is also profoundly convicting in challenging us to embody what we profess to believe. This is not abstract pastoral theology; it is an understanding of ministry for all ministers, lay or professional, who find, perhaps to their surprise or disappointment, that they are human beings, body and soul. If you do ministry, please believe me: <em>Sensing Jesus</em> is must reading.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Denis Haack</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Director, Ransom Fellowship; Visiting Instructor in practical theology, Covenant Seminary</p></p><h2>Gone</h2><p>On a November evening in the West Country, murder detective Jack Caffery arrives to interview the victim of a car-jacking.

Vocalist Celine Dion and photographer Anne Geddes conceived Miracle as a way to express something deep within their own hearts, and now both the experience and the outcome will delight music and visual art fans throughout the world.Miracle features more than 100 stunning new Geddes images. Each frame reflects the beauty, grace, and magic of both the photographer and her subject. Babies enfolded in blooms, mothers embracing the life flowering within: Anne&#39;s artistic eye captures it all. The exquisite images are wedded with the lyrics to all-new songs by Dion, created and performed on the book-accompanying CD in Celine&#39;s unmistakable international superstar style. It&#39;s easy to hear how her clear and melodious voice has captivated millions throughout her career. A DVD rounds out this artistic package, exploring the genesis of the Miracle project and taking its audience behind the scenes to witness the making of this memorable production. Celine&#39;s title track music video highlights the DVD.As a complement to this many-faceted experience, Sony Music will release its stand-alone Dion CD concurrent with the book&#39;s debut. AMP is delighted to play a role in bringing this important collaboration to readers and listeners, providing a crossover experience rivaled by few others. Mothers, grown children, grandmothers, friends, and gift givers everywhere will want to join this celebration of wonder.</p><p>Anne Geddes is an internationally renowned photographer highly respected for her successful depiction of childhood&#39;s magic and mystery. Anne&#39;s award-winning images of babies are published in more than 50 countries. Her previous books, translated in as many as 16 languages, have sold more than 16 million copies worldwide.Celine Dion is one of the most popular recording artists in history and has topped music charts since she began performing professionally in 1981. Celine&#39;s album sales alone exceed 160 million copies and have earned her five U.S. Grammy Awards and seven World Music Awards in Europe along the way. Celine&#39;s stage show, A New Day, consistently sells out at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, making it one of the most highly attended productions in Las Vegas history.Geddes's photographs of newborns poised on flowers and within sheer, stockinglike sacs have sold more than 15 million books in more than 50 countries; Dion's multi-octave vocal stylings are unmistakable, from the <i>Titanic</i> soundtrack and far beyond. Dion's attempts and eventual success in having a child were well documented on the supermarket racks; Geddes's success has been the stuff of magazine features for years. Thus this 11" � 13" collaboration has something of an inevitable feel to it, sharing its title with Dion's album of lullabies and apostrophes to children (such as John Lennon's "Beautiful Boy"). The book itself contains more than 100 new full-color Geddes photos, a number of which feature Dion (but not her son, Rene Charles, who was born in 2001 and is thus about a thousand days too old for the project) along with various lovely infants of various hues, and others with Geddes's signature newborn-as-a-flower's-center shots. Lyrics from the songs gently float among the images, which, aside from Dion, are familiar looking&#x2014;and should meet with familiar levels of success. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But it&#39;s hard to leave her house on Maple Street, filled as it is with a lifetime of cherished memories. At the retirement home, Oma complains about everything, from flowers in the hallway to crooked bowling lanes! Emily wants to see Oma happy again, but she doesn&#39;t know what to do. At home, Emily and her mother begin to sort through Oma&#39;s possessions. They find ribbons, lace, curtains and blankets. Surrounded by the faded fabrics, Emily now knows the perfect way to keep Oma&#39;s memories by her side -- by stitching a one-of-a-kind patchwork quilt! Spirited illustrations enhance this uplifting story about lives in transition and the threads of memory that hold them together.</p><p>Paulette Bourgeois is the author of more than 40 books for children, including the In My Neighborhood series and Oma's Quilt. She lives in Toronto, Ontario.<br><br>St�phane Jorisch's work has won many awards, including three Governor General's Awards for Illustration. He lives in Montreal, Quebec.The difficult transition from family home to retirement community is poignantly rendered in this cross-generational tale told from a child's viewpoint. Emily tours her grandmother's empty house one last time before taking the reluctant Oma to her new residence. Bourgeois (author of the Franklin series) creates an immediate nostalgic feeling with Emily's observations. (Oma's house "still smells like cabbage soup, warm yeasty dough, lemon polish and vinegar.") Though the subject is bittersweet, the author keeps the story moving in lighthearted fashion, as optimistic Emily offers her impression of Oma's new home: "There are flowers everywhere.... There is a library... and even bowling on Wednesdays!" A displaced Oma is full of complaints ("The bowling alley lanes are crooked and the rental shoes smell funny" and she takes to calling her fellow residents "Nincompoops!"). Jorisch's (As for the Princess: A Folktale from Quebec) sun-drenched watercolors showing plump chairs and sofas in warm colors maintain a cheery mood. As Emily and her mother sort through Oma's now-boxed-up belongings, the girl suggests that they sew a quilt from them; it provides the cure for Oma's sourpuss facade.

A woman and man sit together in a quayside cafe near Le Havre, observing boats, people in the public square and the play of sunlight. The woman, a writer, muses aloud to her companion about their love, whose nuances inform the book she is writing. Gradually, their relationship becomes the framework for the story of an aging English pair seated nearby, a Captain and his ill, beautiful wife. In a dream-like manner, the English couple's past expands to fill the novel's canvas. As a girl on the Isle of Wright, the wife, Emily L., lived under her parents' rigid rule. The Captain, then a boat boy, loved her but, horribly jealous of the poetry she wrote, destroyed an unfinished lyric, preventing her from further work. The strange engrossing symbiosis of writer and beloved is delineated with passion and clarity in a volume that confirms Duras's reputation as a master. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Warships of the Great Lakes, 1754-1834</h2><p>The age of fighting sail is primarily seen as a contest on the oceans, but there was also a huge, if neglected, naval shipbuilding effort on both sides of the Canadian Great Lakes. For eighty years between 1754 and 1834, these great expanses of fresh water saw the construction of warships that ranged from simple rowing gunboats to gigantic three-deckers that could have held their own in Nelson&#39;s line of battle. This book presents the history of the freshwater navies developed by the French, British and Americans as they struggled to control a wilderness frontier. It concentrates on the ships themselves, pointing up both the similarities and the differences compared with deep-water vessels. As many as possible are illustrated with original draughts and contemporary paintings and prints. Apart from the ships, it also considers the logistics of the building operations, the provision of skilled labour and the supply of guns, revealing a story of human ingenuity and success against odds that surpasses the purely technical interest of the ships - probably the most astounding example being the pre-fabricated frigates that were built in Britain, dismantled, and labouriously hauled in pieces up the St Lawrence for eventual reconstruction on Lake Ontario.</p><p>Winner of the 2001 North American Society for Oceanic History, John Lyman Book Award in the category of Canadian Naval and Maritime HistoryRobert Malcomson is a Canadian historian specialising in naval aspects of the War of 1812.

Since the early 1900s, most studies on animal-human communication have focused on great apes and a few cetacean species. Birds were rarely used in similar studies on the grounds that they were merely talented mimics--that they were, after all, "birdbrains." Experiments performed primarily on pigeons in Skinner boxes demonstrated capacities inferior to those of mammals; these results were thought to reflect the capacities of all birds, despite evidence suggesting that species such as jays, crows, and parrots might be capable of more impressive cognitive feats.</p><p>Twenty years ago Irene Pepperberg set out to discover whether the results of the pigeon studies necessarily meant that other birds--particularly the large-brained, highly social parrots--were incapable of mastering complex cognitive concepts and the rudiments of referential speech. Her investigation and the bird at its center--a male Grey parrot named Alex--have since become almost as well known as their primate equivalents and no less a subject of fierce debate in the field of animal cognition. This book represents the long-awaited synthesis of the studies constituting one of the landmark experiments in modern comparative psychology.</p></p><p>When Irene Pepperberg, a professor at the University of Arizona, says goodnight, she typically hears the reply "Bye. I'm gonna go eat dinner. I'll see you tomorrow." Though the response itself is not unusual, the source is, for it comes from Alex, a gray parrot, Pepperberg's main research subject for the past 22 years. That parrots can talk is well known; what Pepperberg set out to study was their cognitive abilities. By teaching the bird the meaning--not just the sound--of words in order to communicate, she hoped to discover how his brain worked. She exhaustively details her fascinating results in <i>The Alex Studies</i>.<p> Pepperberg bought Alex--a parrot of average intelligence and without lofty pedigree or training--from a pet store when he was 1. Since working with Pepperberg, he has developed a 100-word vocabulary and can identify 50 different objects, recognizing quantities up to six, distinguishing seven colors and five shapes, and understanding the difference between big and small, same and different, over and under. He can tell you, for instance, that corn is yellow even if there is no corn in view, as well as correctly select the square object among various shapes and identify it verbally. What this all means, stresses Pepperberg, is that Alex is not merely parroting but actually thinking; he bases answers on reason rather than instinct or mimicry.</p><p> Though the anecdotes are rich and Alex makes a lively subject, this is principally a research paper relying on intricate details and a prodigious amount of data (the notes and references alone run to 79 pages). This is not light reading, particularly for the layperson. Still, <i>The Alex Studies</i> manages to be more than a valuable contribution to science, for in providing ample evidence of our similarities to other creatures, the book ultimately calls into question the concept of human supremacy over the animal kingdom. Pepperberg's stated goal is "to provoke awareness in humans that animals have capacities that are far greater than we were once led to expect, and to remind us that all we need to examine these capacities are some enlightened research tools." She has provided such tools in this seminal work. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Irene Pepperberg&#39;s studies of Alex are some of the most remarkable and significant in the whole field of animal cognition. Her evidence stands up to the closest scrutiny, and Alex the parrot turns out to have cognitive abilities that were not even suspected before Pepperberg began her work.

In 1982, David Morgan was an RAF officer, on secondment to the Royal Navy, when the Argentine invasion took place. He flew in the first British air strike against the enemy positions around Port Stanley, the raid memorably described by BBC reporter Brian Hanrahan who "counted them all out, and counted them all back." But three out of&nbsp;30 British pilots were killed during the first week. Morgan was first on the scene at Bluff Cove, where Argentine jets had bombed the landing ships&nbsp;Sir Tristram&nbsp;and Sir Galahad, with great loss of life. He and his wingman pounced on four enemy Skyhawk fighter-bombers: he shot down two, his wingman hit the third; the fourth managed to escape after jettisoning his weapons and drop tanks. David Morgan was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery in 1982. He is also credited with downing several helicopters as well as pressing home ground attack missions in the teeth of heavy anti-aircraft fire. After the war, he met one of the Argentine pilots he fought, who had had him in his sights but discovered his guns were jammed. David Morgan is also a published poet and his writing style elevates his story above that of most other war memoirs. He includes heartfelt letters he sent back to England to his wife, his young children, and his former mistress. He had confessed to his affair just as the fleet sailed, and writes very movingly of the difficulty in rescuing personal relationships while sent to war the other side of the world. This intimate account of one pilot's war combines the adrenaline rush craved by every would-be <i>Top Gun</i> pilot with deeply sensitive reflection.</p><p>David Morgan was awarded the DSC for his services in the Falklands War.

It"s a strange word&#x2014;"organizer"&#x2014;a word from the past, a <br>black-and-white photo of a person passing out fliers to workers leaving an <br>auto plant.<br> But it"s 2002, and I am an organizer. Not a consultant to so-called <br>faith-based programs. Not a facilitator. Not an adviser. Not a service provider <br>or do-gooder. Not an ideologue. Not a political operative. Not a pundit. Not a <br>progressive. Not an activist.<br> I"m clearly not a lot of things. In my organizing, I use other old-<br>fashioned words <br>like "leader"and "follower," "power"and "action," "confrontation" <br>and "negotiation," "relationships" and "institutions." These words still form the <br>phonics of the larger language of politics.<br> With these basic tools, the plots and subplots of public life, no <br>matter how intricate, begin to make sense. Characters come to life. <br>Motivations emerge. Relationships reveal themselves. Themes and story <br>lines become clear. The reader can begin to talk back to the teller of the tale, <br>can begin to judge, or can pick up a pen and create a different world. In the <br>public arena, participation and action and change can take place.<br> But I won"t begin to make sense unless I follow the advice of my <br>former college professor and poet laureate, the late Robert Penn Warren, and <br>tell some stories. We took a walk one day on the Connecticut roads near his <br>Fairfield home. It was a brisk winter afternoon, and his dog was yanking him <br>along. As we walked, he provided a gentle but thorough critique of a novel I <br>was working on at the time. He kept coming back to a simple theme: "Just <br>tell the story. Forget everything else and tell your story." He was repeating <br>what he had already written in his wonderful book-length poem, Audubon: A <br>Vision, "Tell me a story. / In this century, and moment, of mania, / Tell me a <br>story / . . . Tell me a story of deep delight." So, many years later, I will follow <br>the advice of this wise teacher and tell you some stories from my life, the <br>beginnings of my life as an organizer.<br> I grew up on the west side of Chicago in the fifties and learned <br>that we live in a world of power&#x2014;raw power&#x2014;long before I knew the word. My <br>mother and father bought a tavern when my sister and I were quite young. As <br>a six-year-old, I served shots and beers to the men who sat along "my" <br>section of the bar. My customers were Italians, Irish, and fellow Croatians. <br>They walked down the hill a block away from the Chicago and Northwestern <br>Railroad yard at noon&#x2014;for a couple of shots, a couple of beers, and <br>sandwiches and soup made by my mother in the kitchen. My father built a <br>small platform behind the bar so that I could serve my crowd.<br> I remember this as a glorious time in my life&#x2014;a time when I was <br>admitted to an adult world of strength and laughter and toughness. (My <br>parents remember this as a period of unremitting pressure and endless <br>work.) The time ended on a sunny afternoon. The young man from the mob <br>came in to pick up his monthly payment. My father explained to him that, <br>because by mother had taken ill, we were short. As my father and the young <br>man talked, all the other men at the bar became silent, looked down at their <br>drinks, or stared straight ahead. The young man told my father that he knew <br>what he had to do. My father nodded. Then the man turned around and <br>walked out. Slowly, conversation picked back up. Someone ordered a shot of <br>vo and a Schlitz. That night, my father closed the bar&#x2014;Gus"s Tavern&#x2014;for <br>good.<br> When he sold the tavern to a Polish immigrant, my father <br>explained to him that there were three "expenses" that did not appear on the <br>books&#x2014;the payoff to the police (otherwise, they would not come if there was <br>trouble), the payoff to the fire department (otherwise, they may not come, or <br>come promptly, if there was a fire), and the payoff to the mob. The Polish <br>fellow was indignant. This was America, not his home country. He would not <br>make these payments, he shouted. My father argued with him, but to no avail.<br> Some months later, after the new owner had made improvements <br>to the tavern, reopened it, and begun to rebuild the business, the word spread <br>through the neighborhood that the tavern would be firebombed that night. No <br>one went into the tavern that night, so the man had sense enough to shut it <br>early. Kids from the neighborhood, myself included, were stationed across <br>the street, sitting on the curb, sipping sodas, watching the darkened bar. A <br>car pulled up to the tavern. A door opened. A man stepped out and heaved <br>two Molotov cocktails through the window. The man was in no hurry and wore <br>no mask. The car pulled slowly away as the building erupted in flames. In <br>seconds, the street turned from night to noon. It seemed like a long time <br>before the police or fire department arrived. And, when they did, the building <br>was gutted, and the owner was wailing on the sidewalk outside.<br> No matter where you turned, you ran smack into people with <br>power. The power of the mob. The power of the police. The power of the Cook <br>County Democratic Party&#x2014;which demanded three hundred dollars from every <br>working man in our neighborhood who sought a city job. Three hundred <br>dollars was a lot of money in those days. And all that it bought was a <br>place "on the list." No one knew for sure, but the sense was that a small <br>percentage of people eventually got jobs. The rest paid off, sat silently, and <br>had nowhere to go and no one to complain to when their payoff didn"t work.<br> Life on the street was no different. As a white, working-class boy, <br>I grew up fighting black, working-class boys. We jumped them. They jumped <br>us. We feared them. And we wanted them to fear us. Our lives were strictly <br>circumscribed&#x2014;divided by el lines, railroad tracks, and major thoroughfares. <br>Cross any border and you had to be prepared to pay the price. Every aspect <br>of our upbringing taught us either to avoid or to confront one another.<br> Our lives were a series of serious and sudden skirmishes. One <br>afternoon, two friends and I were sitting on a curb. In the distance, three <br>blacks, about our age, walked along Ferdinand Street, toward us. They <br>ambled, it seemed to me then and in memory, incredibly slowly and <br>casually. As they approached, the toughest of our three, Mike Stepkovicz, <br>now dead, pulled out his knife, opened it behind his back, and waited. No one <br>moved until they were right in front of us. Then Stecks, short and stocky but <br>quick as a snake, grabbed the lead boy, put the knife to his neck, and asked <br>him where the fuck he thought he was going. The boy"s eyes were wide, <br>unblinking. No words came out of his mouth, although his lips moved. The <br>rest of us just froze. As quickly as he struck, Stecks let the kid go and told <br>him to head back the same way he came. We watched them walk away, <br>faster now, back toward Pulaski Road, south toward Lake Street, out of our <br>turf, out of our sight.<br> And there was the much more complicated power of large <br>institutions&#x2014;particularly the Roman Catholic Church. Our parish, Our Lady of <br>the Angels, anchored our lives. It"s where we prayed, socialized, played <br>bingo, went to school. This same parish&#x2014;and scores like it&#x2014;often turned a <br>blind eye to the needs of the working-class whites who packed its schools <br>and sanctuaries.<br> I watched as my mother tried to convince our local pastor to do <br>something about the real estate hustlers who were panicking white families <br>to leave the neighborhood by warning of the impending flood of black buyers. <br>These hustlers spoke every language we spoke&#x2014;Croatian, Italian, German, <br>and Czechoslovakian. They called every day, many times a day, and then <br>into the evening, and then all through the night. They roused bone-tired <br>factory workers from their beds to alert them to how much their home had <br>lost in value that week, to make them one last offer. Exhaustion and fear <br>grew. Neighbors moved suddenly, without a word of warning. Then panic <br>spread. The real estate agents bought low from our families and sold high to <br>black families eager for a better and safer life for their children. They ravaged <br>entire sections of a once great city&#x2014;several times over. They drove families <br>like mine from neighborhood to neighborhood, two, three, and four times, <br>further west and northwest and southwest toward the suburbs, losing more <br>equity, hope, and faith each time. Then they bankrupted black and Hispanic <br>buyers and steered them into new ghettoes.<br> My mother went to the pastor and described all this. He nodded <br>and said he would get back to her. He never did. We found out later that he <br>essentially redrew the lines of the parish to exclude our four square blocks, <br>which turned from nearly entirely white to nearly entirely black in one <br>traumatic and violent summer in the late sixties. We didn"t move for three <br>more years because my Croatian grandmother, who owned our house, and <br>who would have survived the bombing of Vukovar, refused to leave.<br> My mother"s actions introduced me to a different kind of power&#x2014;<br>an attempt by someone to defend herself and her family, to enlist other <br>families in the effort, to research an issue and understand it well, to take that <br>research and analysis to a place where she thought her work would be <br>welcome. She did all this with a positive spirit. She related as openly to our <br>new black neighbors as to our fleeing white friends. Deeply disappointed by <br>the inaction of the pastor, she didn"t use that disappointment as a reason to <br>retreat from all public matters or to reject her local parish or her larger church.<br> It would have been understandable if she had rejected them. She <br>had already survived one tragedy. On the first day of December in 1958, the <br>parish school, packed with sixteen hundred kids, caught fire. Ninety-five <br>people died that day&#x2014;ninety-two children and three nuns.<br> I recall the sights and sounds of that first of December nearly <br>every day of my life. A siren, a news story, a charred building in Brooklyn, <br>schoolchildren waiting on line or racing around an asphalt playground, <br>inanities from the mouth of a public official trying to avoid responsibility&#x2014;it <br>doesn"t take much to jog my memory.<br> Once again, I am one of fifty or so fourth graders sitting in a <br>crowded classroom copying the perfect script of Sr. Mary <br>Edgar . . . "Geography. Read page fifty-eight. . . ." She is tall and thin and <br>strictly upright, just like the tall and elegant letters on the board. Then, the <br>fire alarm rings, late in the afternoon, just before dismissal, which makes us <br>all groan and grumble quietly. We will have to walk outside without our coats <br>and wait until the entire school empties and then go back in and dress for the <br>end of the day. In other words, we will leave later than usual.<br> But today there will be no going back for coats and books and <br>backpacks. As we file into the hallway, we look up the wide stairwell leading <br>to the second floor. Midway down, smoke, thick as muscle, blocks our view. <br>The groaning and grumbling stop. We hurry out to the sidewalk in front of the <br>school and follow our leader along Iowa Street toward the church. As we <br>walk, we glance back, see smoke pouring from windows.<br> In the church, we are commanded to kneel and pray&#x2014;600, 800, <br>1,000, 1,200, and more frightened kids, more packed in every minute. We <br>can hear windows breaking, muffled screams, and thuds from the school fifty <br>yards away. Someone in my group of friends says, "Let"s get out of here, see <br>if we can help." So we slip out of the pew. We rush, crouching, down the <br>aisle&#x2014;a small pack of ten-year-old boys sneaking through the crush of <br>arriving children.<br> A moment later, we find that we have hurried into a holocaust. <br>Sirens wail from every direction, as if the whole city is keening. The next hour <br>is a blur. We are wandering among the bodies beginning to crowd the <br>sidewalk in front of the school. We are sent into a nearby house. Later, we <br>are running, coatless, bookless, home, running six blocks against a rising <br>tide of parents and brothers and sisters and neighbors, who are pouring <br>toward the school.<br> The crush of fire trucks and ambulance snarled traffic right into the <br>rush hour. My father, like hundreds of other parents, heard this terrible news <br>about the school but could not get home because of the tie-ups. Finally, <br>when he rushed into the house, hours late, covered with lime dust from his <br>day as a plasterer, he looked like a ghost, as did my younger sister and I. He <br>had seen so much death and near-death, from Omaha Beach to the Battle of <br>the Bulge, but nothing had left him feeling so desolate and helpless, he said, <br>as the endless hours of that afternoon.<br> Out on the street, in front of the school, a young priest named <br>Jack Egan performed last rites and comforted the barely living and consoled <br>the parents who were already beyond consolation, and would remain that <br>way, some of them, haunted for the rest of their lives.<br> When ninety-two children die in one neighborhood, along with <br>three religious women who taught them, the entire community mourns. In this <br>case, the "community" extended beyond the streets and avenues of the west <br>side, beyond Springfield and Avers and Harding and Thomas, beyond <br>Augusta and Iowa and Erie, beyond the modest row houses and crowded <br>bungalows and gray two-flats, beyond the decade and the century in which it <br>occurred. In this case, the community included the rest of the city, Catholic <br>schools everywhere, and people of all cities and states. The children of the <br>city were dead&#x2014;the kind of kids who lived in every American city at the time. <br>Their photos filled the entire front page of one of the city"s newspapers a few <br>days later. The event had the impact of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire&#x2014;another <br>instance of tragic loss among working-class women in a New York City <br>knitting mill. Fire safety rose to the top of the national agenda. Dioceses and <br>schools districts campaigned for sprinkler systems and other fire safety <br>solutions.<br> But there was a terrible twist to this tragedy. The ola fire wasn"t <br>caused by an abusive employer showing disregard for his workers. In the city <br>of Chicago, in 1958, Roman Catholic schoolchildren, in their local parish <br>school, in a Roman Catholic city, led by a mayor who attended Mass each <br>and every morning, died unnecessarily. The institution that sometimes gave <br>life, through adoption services; saved life, through their health care and <br>hospitals; supported and enriched life, through their schools and seminaries&#x2014;<br>this same institution exposed its most faithful followers to firetrap conditions <br>and the possibility of injury and death.<br> When the west side of Chicago&#x2014;and scores of neighborhoods <br>like it in many American cities&#x2014;began to burn again, in the mid-sixties, just <br>ten years after the ola fire, when parish after parish experienced a near-total <br>turnover in a matter of months, when hundreds of thousands of hardworking <br>ethnic Catholics were driven from their homes and hundreds of thousands of <br>hardworking blacks and Hispanics were steered in, I saw the same kind of <br>deadly disregard&#x2014;only this time a little less dramatic, less stunning to the <br>senses. This time, it was politicians benefiting from the profiteering of real <br>estate hustlers. This time it was arsonists work...</p><h2>The Undertaker&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>What if the place you called &#x201c;home&#x201d; happened to be a funeral home? Kate Mayfield explores what it meant to be the daughter of a small-town undertaker in this fascinating memoir evocative of <i>Six Feet Under </i>and <i>The Help</i>, with a hint of Mary Roach&#x2019;s <i>Stiff</i>.<br><br><i>The first time I touched a dead person, I was too short to reach into the casket, so my father picked me up and I leaned in for that first, empty, cold touch. It was thrilling, because it was an unthinkable act.</i><br> <br>After Kate Mayfield was born, she was taken directly to a funeral home. Her father was an undertaker, and for thirteen years the family resided in a place nearly synonymous with death. A place where the living and the dead entered their house like a vapor. The place where Kate would spend the entirety of her childhood. In a memoir that reads like a Harper Lee novel, Mayfield draws the reader into a world of Southern mystique and ghosts.<br> <br>Kate&#x2019;s father set up shop in a small town where he was one of two white morticians during the turbulent 1960s. Jubilee, Kentucky, was a segregated, god-fearing community where no one kept secrets&#x2014;except the ones they were buried with. By opening a funeral home, Kate&#x2019;s father also opened the door to family feuds, fetishes, and victims of accidents, murder, and suicide. The family saw it all. They also saw the quiet ruin of Kate&#x2019;s father, who hid alcoholism and infidelity behind a cool, charismatic exterior. As Mayfield grows from trusting child to rebellious teen, she begins to find the enforced hush of the funeral home oppressive, and longs for the day she can escape the confines of her small town.<br> <br>In <i>The Undertaker&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, Kate has written a triumph of a memoir. This vivid and stranger-than-fiction true story ultimately teaches us how living in a house of death can prepare one for life.</p><p>Kate Mayfield is the author of <i>The Undertaker&#x2019;s Daughter</i> (a memoir) and the coauthor of <i>Ten Steps to Fashion Freedom</i> and <i>Ellie Hart Goes to Work</i>.

The camera slowly panned over a casket in which a young woman lay in perfect stillness. I&#x2019;ll never forget how she looked. Her coal-black hair spread over a white satin pillow; her lips, painted a bright cherry red, contrasted brazenly with her gypsumlike skin. She looked like the Disney version of Snow White, except that her thick, black glasses revealed the era of her death to be the 1950s, the grainy film already at least ten years old. Her glasses looked out of place&#x2014;why did she need them now? She didn&#x2019;t, but her family needed them. Their last memory of her required familiar and, therefore, comforting details. The first time I saw a close-up of her face, even with her eyes closed she looked so alive and vibrant that I asked, &#x201c;Is she really dead, or were you all just fooling around?&#x201d;<br> <br>I have tried to remember the first time I saw a dead body. There have been many odd firsts in my life, like the first time I touched a dead person. I was too short to reach into the casket, so my father picked me up and I leaned in for that first empty, cold touch. It was thrilling because it was an unthinkable act. But I recall no first viewing because from the time I entered the world there were always dead bodies.<br> <br>When I was old enough to understand what they meant, people told me they felt decidedly creepy about funeral homes. I knew a woman who always ran to the other side of the street whenever she happened upon ours. She gave a little shudder when she saw me seated in the swing on the veranda. I nodded to her and remained silent, having no need to defend my position, and anyway, sooner or later she, too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I could understand how one would think it a bit unnatural to spend day after day, year after year, entertaining the grieving and caring for their dead.<br> <br>It could have been a gloomy existence were it not for my father. Whenever I mentioned &#x201c;undertaker&#x201d; or &#x201c;mortician&#x201d; to people who&#x2019;d never met him, I saw in their eyes what they thought. They pictured a dour man, a Uriah Heep sort who wore black, scratchy suits with dull white shirts fading to yellow. Nowadays, people raise their brows when they think of the modern undertaker, who burrows down in courses such as General Psychology and Dynamics of Grief, Mortuary Law, and Death and Human Development. These men are thought of as exploitive, nothing more than ruthless businessmen. My father would have squirmed at being compared to them. Each funeral was an opportunity to imprint his stamp, the details of which bore his personal touch. Not one strand of the corpse&#x2019;s hair should go astray, not one of a family&#x2019;s requests should go unheeded. A final perfected image, a memorable experience, was his unwavering goal.<br> <br>He never had to work too hard at being different, he just was.<br> <br>Frank Mayfield was a clotheshorse, an undertaker with flair that verged on dandyism. He thought nothing of driving miles to hunt down a better-quality suit, no easy task given that our little, rural town did not border any large metropolis.<br> <br>My father allowed me to observe as he groomed his dark brown, wavy hair into a matinee-idol sweep. I sat on the sink or stood in the claw-foot bath to gain a little height and squirted the Brylcreem into his palm, but the stuff did nothing to tame the dramatic widow&#x2019;s peak that marked his forehead. Long, curly, black lashes accented his hazel eyes, and a prominent swath of dark eyebrows ran across his forehead. I swear he looked like a movie star.<br> <br>He never struggled when dressing. His fingers and hands played with his diamond cuff links as I imagined they might have swept up jacks and a ball, nimbly and quickly. The eye-catching ties did not demand extra time or attention, but magically knotted themselves into place as if he were only there to assist. He had leaned over hundreds of men as they slept the deep sleep of death, slipping their ties under their collars and knotting the fabric one last time. His reputation depended upon the perfection of such a task.<br> <br>On the last day of 1959 my father, the Beau Brummell of morticians, piled us into his green-and-white DeSoto and drove away from Lanesboro, the city in which my older brother and sister and I were born, and toward a small town on the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Though only a ninety-minute drive, it might as well have been to Alaska.<br> <br>Gliding into Jubilee, our big boat of a car circled the town square and headed toward the residential section of Main Street. My father pulled over, and our five dark heads turned to face a huge, three-story, slightly run-down house. In this old house he would finally realize his dream of owning his own funeral home.<br> <br>Back in Lanesboro, I had been the first in our family to be carried as a newborn from the hospital directly into a funeral home. Birth and death in almost the same breath. My brother and sister, Thomas and Evelyn, had enjoyed living in a normal house until my father&#x2019;s employer forced him to move into the funeral home in Lanesboro so that he could be available at any time of the day or night.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if we&#x2019;re going to live in a funeral home, it might as well be one that I own,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said upon deciding to move.<br> <br>My mother told me that the first week after our move to Jubilee, I held on to the hem of her skirts and would not let go. Where she went, I followed. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t let me out of your sight,&#x201d; she said. Then I turned a corner, let go of that familiar fabric, and slowly became fascinated with the funeral home.<br> <br>The front door opened into the office, a space from which traffic seemed to want to flow and not linger. My father kept it simple; he thought a plush office would appear pretentious. His hefty wooden desk nearly dwarfed what was barely a room at all. In front of the desk and against a windowed wall, several wooden folding chairs formed a row into which family members sat to make funeral arrangements. In this room the families of our town made difficult decisions, sometimes numbly asking how this event came about so quickly. &#x201c;Why, just the other day Truman was mowing the lawn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; My father would gently steer them back to reality.<br> <br>When a death occurred, an entire series of rituals shifted into gear. My father led each grieving family on a journey as they completed the necessary funeral arrangements. From the office, they first approached a large foyer. On the right, the Hammond organ loomed in a small corner, and on the left, they walked past the large, open entry that led directly into the chapel, where their recently departed would be on view in a matter of hours. Opposite the chapel&#x2019;s doorway, a tall staircase flanked by a wooden banister led upstairs to our private rooms. Most people respected the boundary and resisted the temptation, but something about a nice staircase beckons.<br> <br>One night while the people downstairs milled about during a visitation, I lay sprawled on my stomach upstairs leafing through a coloring book. Crayons were scattered on the carpet. I heard the familiar creak of the stairs, which I assumed was my mother making her way up for the evening. I quietly walked toward the top of the stairs, where, in a dull glow that emanated from the lights downstairs, stood a beanpole of a man wearing overalls and a suit jacket. Shocked and suddenly vulnerable in my nightgown, we stared at each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he asked, his mouth agape.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I took a step back.<br> <br>Then I heard my father racing up the stairs. &#x201c;Mr. Granger, the bathroom&#x2019;s downstairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that, Frank? Do you see a child?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, of course. She&#x2019;s one of my daughters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean you and your family live up here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, we do. Now if you&#x2019;ll just step down here with me, I&#x2019;ll direct you to the restroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t never heard the likes of that, Mr. Mayfield. I&#x2019;da never known if I ain&#x2019;t seen it with my own eyes, a family on top of a funeral parlor. I swear, I thought I seen a ghost.&#x201d;<br> <br>That happened occasionally, when the rooms downstairs were full of people and it was hard to keep track of everyone. Beyond the staircase, the foyer narrowed into a hallway so dim that a ceiling light burned throughout the day. To the left, a small, humble hospitality room was comfort enough for those who came to visitations and funerals. Here families and their friends paused for a hot or cold drink and murmured in low whispers. An old-fashioned snack machine stood against the wall filled with packs of Planters peanuts, Nabs crackers, and candy bars that dropped into the tray after the money rattled down. Bright red knobs protruded from the cream-colored frame, and I could almost hear the old machine asking to be touched. &#x201c;Not so hard,&#x201d; my father would say when I pulled with all my might.<br> <br>Farther down the hall to the left was a door that always remained closed. This room pressed upon my childhood, possessing the power to scare the bejesus out of a grown man, conjuring the stuff of nightmares. This room housed the monstrous white porcelain table, the knowledge of which hastened my step when I walked past each day: the embalming room.<br> <br>My father ushered family members past the embalming room where their loved one lay under a crisp white sheet, to the door facing them at the end of the hall. This was &#x201c;the showroom&#x201d; where they would choose the casket. One of the last choices the family made with my father took place in the casket room, my room of cold comfort, the only room downstairs spacious enough to accommodate a large array of caskets. It was, as if by design, the end of the journey. This journey from the front of the funeral home to the back, made with countless families over the years, became the rhythm of my childhood.<br> <br>One of the first things my father did when we moved to Jubilee was to contact Southern Bell to make sure we had enough telephones. The telephone, which brought news of tragedy and death, was our lifeline. At that time funeral homes also operated as an emergency service. As the world&#x2019;s surgeons became more skilled, the reasons to bring doctors&#x2019; patients to the hospital increased. Funeral-home ambulance service began as an outgrowth of their need to transport human bodies supine in their long hearses. When a citizen needed to go to the hospital, or just wanted a ride to the doctor&#x2019;s office, they called the funeral home of their choice. The telephones in our new house were sacred objects, and one could be found in almost every room downstairs and upstairs. They rang at all hours of the day and night, the volume cranked as high as it could go. Every time they rang, it sounded like a house full of alarm clocks going off. Two of them sat importantly on the corner of my father&#x2019;s desk. On each of the flesh-colored telephones a row of clear-plastic buttons lit up whenever we received a call. I couldn&#x2019;t keep my hands off them and played with the buttons when no one was looking, intrigued by how the light flashed first and the tone came afterward, like a warning strobe light&#x2014;death calling, death calling. I still can never hear a phone ring without thinking that someone, somewhere, has died.<br> <br>When a death call came the entire atmosphere in our home changed instantly. My father ran out to the three-car garage in the back of the property and revved up his Henney-Packard ambulance. What a piece of fast-rolling machinery. The Packard ambulance&#x2014;a smaller version of our black hearse, which had the sharp, sleek lines of the later-model Cadillacs&#x2014;looked like a long, fat cigar. It was known for its disturbingly named &#x201c;suicide doors&#x201d;: the back doors were rear-hinged and susceptible to all manner of dangers. If one of them opened accidentally, the force could cause the ambulance to swerve either into oncoming traffic or onto the side of the road&#x2014;and that wasn&#x2019;t the half of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember the undertaker in Mullen County?&#x201d; My father loved to tell this story, erupting in peals of laughter before he began, which anyone listening echoed. &#x201c;This undertaker, Fred Bowles was his name, picked up a patient at his home to take him to the hospital. It wasn&#x2019;t an emergency; the man just needed a comfortable ride. Well, the patient&#x2019;s doctor was at his house, too, and wanted a lift in the ambulance. Fred told the doctor to sit in the front, but, no, this old crank just had to sit in the back with his patient. I remember Fred said he was pretty hot under the collar about it. You know, everybody thinks they can just sit back there, go for a ride like they know what they&#x2019;re doing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, this doctor got real hot sittin&#x2019; back there and took it upon himself to open the window on the passenger side. Well, hell, what did he do? He opened the damn door by mistake. I tell you what, that wind got ahold of that suicide door and it flew back, and it was like the wind just sucked him out and that old crank fell out of the ambulance. And you know what else? The door came swinging back and gave him a good smack before he hit the ground.&#x201d; And here, my father finished between fits of laughter, &#x201c;Fred wasn&#x2019;t going fast, the doctor was all right, a little bruised, but he never asked if he could ride in the back again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whenever my father set out to bring a body home to us, my mother became the noise police. She marched through the rooms upstairs like a sergeant major, her solid frame following her headfirst walk, spreading the word to her children.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a body,&#x201d; she clipped. &#x201c;And you know what that means, so get to it!&#x201d;<br> <br>I sighed. Another one? A dead body in the house meant we would be sequestered. Even though many of Jubilee&#x2019;s dead rested with us over the years, we were the ghosts of the house. Our family learned how to disappear with those four words: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a body.&#x201d; From the time the family of the deceased first entered the door to make arrangements until days later when the last person left after the funeral, our family became invisible, nonexistent. We tiptoed around upstairs and whispered to each other when it was necessary to communicate. The sound of music or the television would not be heard in our house until the last mourner walked out the door. Foods that emitted strong odors were out of the question so that we wouldn&#x2019;t offend the bereaved with a reminder of life going on above them. The volume of the chiming phones was lowered to a softer, duller ring.<br> <br>The days and evenings of visitation culminated in the funeral service. The chatter of the visitors halted, the movement of people downstairs calmed, and now, during the actual funeral service, we weren&#x2019;t even allowed to speak or walk upstairs. We created a hush and the house fell silent.<br> <br>Funeral services were usually held in the afternoons when Thomas and Evelyn were at school. Thomas was already in junior high school and Evelyn was two years behind him at the end of a less than spectacular grade-school career. They were more occupied with new teachers and friends than the business of death. Thomas was particularly industrious and soon became familiar with Jubilee&#x2019;s various neighborhoods when he began a paper route. He delivered the Nashville Tennessean, a daily afternoon paper that occasionally reported on a few counties in Kentucky. Jubilee&#x2019;s newspaper came out only once a week, filled most prominently with the news of lost cows, ice-cream-supper locations, and, most important, the obituaries, which my mother proofread with a magnifying glas...</p><h2>Cure for the Common Life: Living in Your Sweet Spot</h2><p>NEW NEVER READ</p><p></p><h2>National Portrait Gallery Insights: The Romantic Poets And Their Circle</h2><p>The popular ideal of the inspired artist, beautiful, brooding and young, owes its origin to portraits of the poets, writers and artists of the Romantic period.

Treating Bataille&#39;s work as a whole rather than focusing, as other studies have done, on aspects of his work (i.e. as social theory or philosophy), Noys&#39; study is intended to be sensitive to the needs of students new to Bataille&#39;s work while at the same time drawing on the latest research on Bataille to offer new interpretations of Bataille&#39;s oeuvre for more experienced readers.

It provides a new path through a traditional Metis worldview to holistic wellness. Spirit Gifting contrasts this traditional worldview with Western Scientific knowledge to provide a model of self-discovery and individual revitalization, something that more and more of us are seeking. It is a reflection of a life lived by nature&#39;s calendar; a refreshing change from the ninety mile an hour treadmill most of us find ourselves on. This first person narrative is teeming with life; from his description of birch tree sapping to berry picking time. You can taste the syrup in your mouth, or feel the chill of the slough as you read. His description of a time when humans worked with the land, with life, makes it abundantly clear, that in our rush to support progress with machines and ever more power, we have lost our respect for life. It was quietly left behind. Spirit Gifting suggests we look at what we&#39;ve lost, honour life and nature and all the gifts they provide, and quietly bring that respect back into our lives. Join Elmer Ghostkeeper, as he explores his early years of living with the land rather than off the land. This book is for Metis, Native and Non-Native people looking for a way to revitalize their sprituality, and to learn how to connect with the Earth and its Creator. Elmer Ghostkeeper, a successful academic and businessman, grew up on a farm on the Paddle Prairie Metis Settlement in Alberta, Canada. His family worked with the land using horses rather than mechanized farm vehicles. Learn how their syncretic spirituality supported their lives and livelihoods, and how it can improve your life and livelihood.</p><p>This is a book for Metis, for First Nations, and for citizens of the world at large. It would prove beneficial for anyone to hear Ghostkeeper&#39;s eloquent description of life on the prairie, growing up in a Metis family in a Metis community. The lessons are large and spiritual in an unexpected way.In his book, Spirit Gifting, Mr. Elmer Ghostkeeper of Paddle Prairie describes Metis traditional knowledge as "the body of information, rules, and values which made existence possible and meaningful for a Metis group of people before they were overwhelmed by influence of foreign codes." He explains the essential elements of traditional knowledge as they relate to relationship and response of the Metis to the environment as follows: <p>"This knowledge involved a sacred worldview in which the Great Spirit, who can also be conceived as our Creator, Our Father, or Our Mother, created spirit helpers and messengers, referred to us as Our Grandfathers and Our Grandmothers. Our creator also created the land as a gift, referred to as Mother Earth. Plants, people, and other animals were also viewed as gifts because they were part of the land. Relationships between people and the other gifts were characterized by spiritual exchanges which continually renew the body, mind, emotion and spirit. </p><p>Our way of making a living was with the land. The land was used for basic subsistence and with small surplus, rather than for profit, and the use of land was marked by an ongoing round of ceremonies, rituals and sacrifices. The gifts from Mother Earth were viewed in concrete terms, and ownership was viewed as collective stewardship. The essence of holistic livelihood was sharing, giving, and receiving in an attempt to keep body, mind, emotion, and spirit in balance. To the extent this was done, the individual existed in a spiritual state, and was happy and healthy." </p><p>Elsewhere in his text he remembers: </p><p>"Through these activities it is clear that the essence of my relationships with my family was primarily spiritual. They were based upon local traditions of preparing and sharing gifts obtained from the land. The Great Spirit was the donor of these gifts of food, which consisted of the aspects of the mind, emotion, spirit, and body of plants and animals. My family were the recipients. The concept of Spirit Gifting was incorporated into every activity of livelihood, through the ceremony, ritual, and sacrifice which made it possible for my family to live a happy and healthy life throughout this year. I was taught to respect the land, plants and animals because we were created with all the same aspects, adapted to live in the same environment, and were equal as gifts to one another."</p></p><h2>The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia</h2><p>Which poison was used most frequently in Agatha Christie's novels?

Her father was an American who had business connections to both America and England, and her mother was the niece of Frederick's stepmother. The family established firmer ties to the United States with their decision to move to New England from Torquay in 1879 shortly after the birth of their first child, Madge. While in America in 1880, Clara gave birth to their second child, Monty. Soon after, the family set off for England again, but Frederick was forced by business to return across the Atlantic, and suggested that the family continue on to Torquay and rent a house. Upon his return, however, Frederick learned that Clara had actually purchased a house, Ashfield, and, despite initial plans to sell it after a time and return to America, the Millers decided to remain at the home and become permanent residents in England.<br><br>The third child of the family, Agatha grew up essentially an only child. Madge and Monty were much older than she was and were away at school most of the time. Her early education was at home, and her parents initially were worried that she might be developmentally challenged because of her severe shyness. This concern was proven groundless as Agatha soon displayed much of the curiosity and love of learning that characterized her later years. The happiness of her youth was shattered, however, in 1901, when Frederick died. It was a severe a blow to the family, both from a personal and a financial standpoint. It became necessary, for example, for Agatha's mother to rent out Ashfield from time to time to make ends meet, meaning that she and Agatha would travel under very austere circumstances during the times when Ashfield was occupied.<br><br>Her mother made certain that Agatha received a suitable education, and, in 1906, she was sent to Paris to attend a finishing school. While there, she earned a reputation as a gifted singer and showed a talent for music. There was, in fact, some discussion about the possibility of Agatha's becoming a professional singer, but the notion did not long endure. Throughout her long life, she retained a love of music and an ability to play the piano.<br><br>An attractive and intelligent young woman, Agatha became the recipient of a number of marriage proposals. She declined all of them until 1912, when she accepted the offer of a major in the Gunners (Artillery). The very next year, she met the dashing Captain Archibald Christie, who swept her off her feet at a party. He was a guest at Ashfield a few days later, making a grand entrance on a motorcycle. Within a short time, she accepted his offer of marriage and sat down to write the painful letter to her first fianc� announcing the cancellation of their planned wedding. On Christmas Eve, 1914, Agatha and Archibald were wed. Two days later, Archie was sent off to fight in World War I.<br><br>While Archie was away, Agatha volunteered in a local hospital as a nurse and was eventually moved to the hospital pharmacy and dispensary. There, she encountered many of the poisons that were to be featured in her later writings and even gained firsthand knowledge of at least one possible plot for a murder (see <i>The Pale Horse,</i> page 115, for details). By 1916, she had decided to try her hand at writing and had been working on a mystery novel. Partly to alleviate the boredom of being a war wife and also because she seemed to have a natural gift for plotting out the details of a novel, Christe stayed at her book. The result was <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles.</i> After submitting it unsuccessfully to several publishers, her first novel found a home at John Lane and was published in 1920. Owing to the terms of her contract, she made virtually no money from the book, and she remained initially uncertain whether a writing career was feasible.<br><br>After Archie's return and the end of the war, the Christies settled in London, where Archie took a position in a bank. In 1919, Rosalind Christie, Agatha's only child, was born. Christie continued writing, and in 1922 her second novel, <i>The Secret Adversary,</i> was published. It was written mainly to assist with the upkeep of Ashfield, although Archie encouraged her in her writing. She soon signed with the literary agents Hughes Massie, Ltd., and, before long, her unprofitable and draconian contract with John Lane was terminated. After that, she was signed with the ambitious publisher William Collins Sons and Co., Ltd. Her first book with them was <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> (1926), one of the most breathtaking, innovative, and popular mysteries of the twentieth century. Her relationship with Collins endured to the end of her life.<br><br>Agatha dedicated her third novel, <i>Murder on the Links</i> (1923), "To my husband," and noted in her autobiography that she was "happy" during this period. Strains began to appear as early as 1924, however, stemming at least in part from Archie's obsession with golf. By 1926, there was considerable distance between Archie and Agatha, so much so that Agatha took a holiday to Corsica without him in the early part of the year. It proved a portentous beginning to a very dramatic year.<br><br>Upon returning home, Agatha learned that her mother was seriously ill with bronchitis. Clara Miller died only days later, and Agatha faced the disaster alone, as Archie was away in Spain. He returned to England, learned of the death of his mother-in-law, and promptly set out again. Even after he came back, he still stayed away from Agatha, preferring to remain in London or at the recently acquired family home in Berkshire, Styles House.<br><br>In the midst of this tragedy, Christie earned national acclaim with the June release of <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.</i> She was still recovering from her mother's death when Archie made the announcement that he wanted a divorce. He had fallen in love with another woman, Nancy Neele. Out of consideration for Rosalind, Archie moved back to Styles House for an attempted reconciliation. As Christie wrote in her autobiography, it was "a period of sorrow, misery, heartbreak." By early December, the reunion was over. Archie announced that he was leaving again, this time for good, to be with Nancy. The episode that followed still remains a mystery.<br><br>One day, Agatha Christie returned home to Styles House and discovered Archie gone. She then packed a bag and drove away. Her car was found the following morning over an embankment at Newlands Corner, Berkshire. The hood was up and the lights were on; inside the car was a fur coat and a suitcase, as well as Agatha's expired driver's license. The police subsequently issued a missing person report, a news flash that gripped the imagination of the country, especially as <i>Roger Ackroyd</i> was still one of the best-selling books of the year. <i>The Daily Mail</i> offered a reward of one hundred pounds for Agatha's discovery and police everywhere were on the lookout for her.<br><br>The uproar ended unceremoniously when the reward was claimed by Bob Tappin, a musician at the Hydro Hotel in Harrogate. He recognized Christie as a guest (she was registered under the name Teresa Neele) and claimed the money. Police and Archie Christie raced to the hotel. After meeting with Agatha in private, Archie made a public statement that his wife "has suffered the most complete loss of memory and does not know who she is." This was the position reiterated in public statements by the author. The matter is still a "mystery, with no complete answer given to the disappearance's many nagging questions. Christie herself did not touch upon the matter in her autobiography, and the closest thing to an official statement made by her about it in later years was published in Janet Morgan's authorized biography. Morgan, who had access to many papers unavailable to other writers, supported Christie's original claims of amnesia.<br><br>The disappearance of Agatha Christie remains one of the most intriguing episodes in the eventful life of the author. As she never addressed the issue publicly, Christie's precise activities during her several missing days served as fodder for rumor and theory, and the amount of gossip and speculation, combined with the vicious treatment she received from the press left Christie understandably reluctant for the rest of her life to deal with the media and to have her private life once more the subject of ridicule and scandalmongering.<br><br>There was, however, a continuing interest in the disappearance, with researchers and writers attempting to piece together the author's activities. A fictional account of the disappearance was penned in 1978 by Kathy Tynan (with an adaptation to film in 1979, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman). Another theory was recently offered by Jared Cade in his <i>Agatha Christie and the Eleven Missing Days</i> (1998). He postulated that the disappearance was a calculated effort by Agatha to humiliate her husband, Archie. The theory was rejected forcefully by Mathew Prichard, the dedicated defender of his grandmother's memory.<br><br>During the period of recovery from the trauma, Agatha lived at Styles with Archie, but their marriage was at an end. She finally granted him, albeit reluctantly, a divorce. By the end Of 1927, after a long period of writer's block, she was back at work. Her divorce was finalized in 1928, and Christie was able to make a joke about the entire ghastly affair in the dedication of <i>The Mystery of the Blue Train</i> by giving praise to members of the "O.F.D." (Order of the Faithful Dogs). She considered the divorce to have been an "acid test" for her friends. Those who remained devoted were members of the O.F.D., while those who had abandoned her were made members of the Order of the Rats, third class. The two most conspicuous members of the Faithful Dogs, as noted in her dedication, were Carlo (her secretary, Charlotte) and Peter, her wirehaired terrier.<br><br>In 1928, Christie also went to the Middle East and visited the archaeological dig at Ur. She became friendly with the dig director, Leonard Woolley, and his wife, Katharine. While on a second visit, she met Max Mallowan, the twenty-six-year-old archaeological assistant to Woolley. The two were married on September 11, 1930, in Scotland. Their marriage proved a genuinely happy one, lasting for forty-six years and ending only with Agatha's death. At the time of their union, Agatha was thirty-nine and Max was twenty-six. For purposes of her books, Agatha retained the name Agatha Christie, but, in private life, she always referred to herself as Mrs. Mallowan, and her nonfiction account of life on an archaeological dig, <i>Come Tell Me How You Live,</i> was published under the name Agatha Christie Mallowan.<br><br>Max was a brilliant archaeologist, and Agatha happily devoted much of her time to working with him on his many digs in the Middle East. She became a bona fide member of the archaeological team, and recorded the details of her daily activities in <i>Come Tell Me How You Live.</i> Max's most important dig was at Nimrud, which began around 1949. As always, Agatha was at his side, assisting him for the next ten years. It was while at the dig at Nimrud that she first started work on her autobiography, at which laboring sporadically for fifteen years. In 1960, Max was honored with the rank of Commander of the British Empire, not for being the husband of Agatha Christie but for his many contributions to archaeology and to the advancement of our knowledge about the ancient world. He published a documentary history of the dig at Nimrud, <i>Nimrud and Its Remains,</i> in 1966. Two years later, Queen Elizabeth II knighted him for his work.<br><br>Even as she assisted her husband -- and adored work on the digs -- Christie continued her staggeringly prolific writing career. She produced about one book a year and enjoyed an especially productive period during World War II, when she wrote such works as <i>Sad Cypress</i> (1940), <i>One, Two, Buckle My Shoe</i> (1940), <i>Evil under the Sun</i> (1941), <i>N or M?</i> (1941), <i>The Body in the Library</i> (1942), <i>Five Little Pigs</i> (1943), <i>The Moving Finger</i> (1943), <i>Towards Zero</i> (1944), <i>Death Comes As the End</i> (1945), <i>Sparkling Cyanide</i> (1945), and <i>Sleeping Murder</i> and <i>Curtain,</i> the two long final cases for Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, respectively.<br><br>Aside from its period of great productivity, the war brought to Christie the terrible uncertainty of the London Blitz and bombings by the Luftwaffe as well as a personal tragedy. Her daughter, Rosalind Christie, had married Hubert Prichard early in the war, and, in 1944, the young man was killed in the fighting. The grief of his death was relieved in many ways by the presence of Mathew Prichard, Christie's grandson, who had been born on September 21, 1943. Agatha loved her grandson, regularly sending him advance copies of her books while he was away at school and even giving him the copyright to <i>The Mousetrap</i> as a present for his tenth birthday. In 1949, Rosalind was married again, this time to Anthony Hicks, of whom Agatha approved most enthusiastically.<br><br>In addition to her work on archaeological digs and her gargantuan literary efforts, Christie also enjoyed a career as a playwright. Her first play, <i>Black Coffee,</i> was staged in 1930 and starred the great actor Francis Sullivan. Christie never saw it, however, as she was in Mesopotamia at the time. It was the success of <i>Ten Little Indians</i> (1940) that convinced her to continue on as a playwright and sparked a period of much stage writing, which included <i>Appointment with Death</i> (1945), <i>Murder on the Nile</i> (1946), <i>The Murder at the Vicarage</i> (1949), and <i>The Hollow</i> (1951). These were, in many ways, mere preludes to her most successful play -- and one of the most successful and enduring plays of all time -- <i>The Mousetrap.</i> Her triumph was followed the next year by the immensely popular <i>Witness for the Prosecution</i> (1953).<br><br>In 1956, Christie was given formal recognition for her place in literature and the arts. She was named a Commander of the British Empire. In 1971, she was declared a Dame of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. That same year, she suffered a leg injury. It marked the beginning of a sharp decline in her health and her productivity. It is commonly agreed that her last two novels, <i>Elephants Can Remember</i> (1972) and <i>Postern of Fate</i> (1973), were not of the same quality as her previous works, and <i>Postern of Fate</i> proved to be her last original work. Later, however, Christie published her final Poirot and Marple novels, <i>Curtain</i> (1975) and <i>Sleeping Murder</i> (1976), which had been sitting in vaults since World War II. They were a fitting cap to an unprecedented literary career.<br><br>Dame Agatha made her final public appearances at the 1974 gala premiere of the film <i>Murder on the Orient Express,</i> screened at the ABC cinema on Shaftesbury Avenue, London, with Queen Elizabeth in attendance, and at the banquet held at Claridge's afterward. She died on January 12, 1976, at her home at Wallingford, Berkshire. Max Mallowan survived his beloved Agatha by two years, dying on August 19, 1978. As per her request, Christie was buried in a private ceremony at Saint Mary's churchyard, Cholsey, Berkshire. Her simple tombstone was inscribed with two lines from Edmund Spenser's <i>The Faerie Queene:<br><br>Sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas,<br><br>Ease after warre, death after life, does greatly please.</i><br><br>Copyright � 2000 by Matthew Bunson</p><h2>The Key To Your Child&#39;s Heart: Proven Steps That Will Help You Raise Motivated, Obedient, and Loving Children</h2><p><p>In this child-rearing classic, Gary Smalley cuts to the relational heart of parenting to show readers proven methods that can spell the difference between an angry, rebellious, distant child and a happy, cooperative one.</p></p><p><p>Gary Smalley was one of the country's best-known authors and speakers on family relationships.

Several of his books have been translated into English, including &#34;Zoo, or Letters Not about Love, Third Factory, Theory of Prose, A Sentimental Journey, Energy of Delusion&#34;, and &#34;Literature and Cinematography&#34;, and &#34;Bowstring&#34;.&#x201c;The works of Viktor Shklovsky are so appropriate to our contemporary situation as to seem to have been written for us. His writings do precisely what he has said it is art&#x2019;s goal to do: they &#x2018;restore . . . sensation of the world,&#x2019; they &#x2018;resurrect things and kill pessimism.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Lyn Hejinian)<br><br>&#x201c;Shklovsky is a disciple worthy of Sterne. He has appropriated the device of infinitely delayed event, of the digression helplessly promising to return to the point, and of disguising his superbly controlled art with a breezy nonchalance.

At its launch at the Irish Film Institute in March 2001, John Montague compared it to a baby Field Day. That was high praise indeed but I was quick to counter that it carried the word 'reader' in the title, not 'anthology'. A reader is less grand than an anthology and is more a workbook than a bible. As I return to it today I am shocked by its size and all the effort that went into it. Footnotes alone took me a year. Having said that, let me also register something else. Brendan Kennelly thought the book should be in every school in Ireland, and it does have the look of the classroom about it. But it's also designed for other kinds of readers - for readers who don't have the time to spend in research libraries, for those who want a survey of the field of modern Irish writing in a handy format, or for those who just want to browse. I was also looking to readers outside of Ireland among the 70 million who claim Irish descent around the world. In that sense it's a Reader that consciously seeks out new readers among the ever-widening and ever-deepening and thoughtful diaspora. When I'm asked would I do it again, I reply with another question 'Could I do it again?'"...a terrifically useful book for an understanding of Irish writing and thought over the past 100 years. Specialists in Irish literature will be glad to have a book that collects in one place so many useful writings not easily tracked down. Students in courses on Irish literature will find this an extremely helpful course reader, complete with appropriate pedagogical suggestions and guides." -- Vincent Cheng, Shirley Sutton Thomas Professor of English, University of Utah <p> "David Pierce has packed this treasure-trove with skill and good taste. Irish writing has rarely had so well-informed a reader, who has gone outside the accepted canon just as he has looked beyond the island's shores. This is a broad and accommodating view of the culture and its dialogue with politics, languages, and recurrent problems." -- W.J.

To critics the world over, Guant�namo Bay, Cuba, is a striking symbol of American hypocrisy. But the prison isn't the whole story. For more than two centuries, Guant�namo has been at the center of American imperial ambition, first as an object of desire then as a convenient staging ground.</p><p>In <i>Guant�namo: An American History</i>, Jonathan M. Hansen presents the first complete account of this fascinating place. The U.S. presence at Guant�namo predates even the nation itself, as the bay figured centrally in the imperial expansion plans of colonist and British sailor Lawrence Washington&#x2015;half brother of the future president George. As the young United States rose in power, Thomas Jefferson and his followers envisioned a vast "empire of liberty," which hinged on U.S. control of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Politically and geographically, Guant�namo Bay was the key to this strategy. So when Cubans took up arms against their Spanish rulers in 1898, America swooped in to ensure that Guant�namo would end up firmly in its control. </p><p>Over the next century, the American navy turned the bay into an idyllic modern Mayberry&#x2015;complete with bungalows, cul-de-sacs, and country clubs&#x2015;which base residents still enjoy. In many ways, Guant�namo remains more quintessentially American than America itself: a distillation of the idealism and arrogance that has characterized U.S. national identity and foreign policy from the very beginning.</p><p>Despite the Obama administration's repeated efforts to shutter the notorious prison, the naval base is in no danger of closing anytime soon. Places like Guant�namo, which fall between the clear borders of law and sovereignty, continue to serve a purpose regardless of which leaders&#x2015;left, right, or center&#x2015;hold the reins of power.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan M.

Hunters from a village up the Guantnamo Valley gathered food for a celebratory feast.1 Using traps, nets, hooks, and harpoons, and perhaps working from canoes, the hunters were having a good time of it. Within a few hours, they had hauled in roughly one hundred pounds of fish, which they set about preserving for the journey home. Meanwhile, a second group of hunters pursued alligators that made their homes along the banks of the rivers that fed Guantnamo Bay. They, too, were enjoying a good day, and before long the bay was perfumed by wood smoke from fires sizzling with fresh fish and alligator meat hung from wooden spits.2An ordinary day at Guantnamo became memorable sometime in the midafternoon, when three large vessels topped by billowing white sails appeared off the entrance to the bay. News of the foreign fleet's return to the Americas had preceded it to Cuba, borne by fleeing villagers from nearby Hispaniola.3 With scarcely time to conceal themselves, the hunters withdrew into the hills and bushes bordering the bay, leaving their game roasting over the fires. Aware of the strangers' advantage in weaponry, the hunters could only watch as the strangers disembarked and devoured the fish, all the while eschewing the alligator, the more precious delicacy in local circles.4With their stomachs full, the strangers set out to explore the surroundings,as if to identify if not thank the people who had so amply provided for them. Still, the hunters shrank back, until finally appointing an envoy to find out what the strangers wanted. Moving forward, the envoy was met not by one of the newcomers but by a fellow Arawak speaker whom the strangers had snatched off one of the Bahama islands.5 Convinced at last that the strangers had stopped at the bay for only a quick visit, the hunters abandoned their hiding places and approached their guests with caution and generosity. Never mind the hundred pounds of fish, the interpreter was assured; the hunters could recover that in a matter of hours. There followed an exchange of gifts and pleasantries, after which the strangers reboarded their vessels and went to bed, the better to rise early, set sail, and finally put to rest the impious notion that Cuba was an island and not the continent of Asia.6&nbsp;<br>The people who discovered Columbus helping himself to their dinner that day had preceded him by nearly a millennium. The Tano, as Columbus's unwitting hosts are known today, were themselves recent arrivals in eastern Cuba.7 They had been beaten to the bay by still earlier discoverers, who began to harvest Guantnamo's resources as early as 1000 BCE.8 Guantnamo's first discoverers hailed from the west, hopping over islands, now submerged, that once connected Central America to Cuba via Jamaica some seven thousand years ago.9 These so-called Casimiroid people found in Guantnamo a cornucopia of flora and fauna with no one to compete for it. The Casimiroids exploited Guantnamo Bay more as a hunting ground than as a home. For them, the bay comprised part of a larger ecosystem that met the requirements of Stone Age living. From the mudflats and mangrove-lined terraces of the outer harbor, the Casimiroids took shellfish, fish, and game, and materials for the simple tools that facilitated their hunting and scavenging. Along the streambeds and river valleys that fed the inner harbor, they drew water and collected wild fruit and vegetation. Theirs was a difficult, prosaic life. Their impact on the Guantnamo Basin was negligible. The vast bay easily absorbed their sparse population, and for their first two thousand years in Cuba, they had few if any rivals.10As the Casimiroids were wending their way toward Guantnamo, another people--horticultural, sedentary, ceramic--began to stir deep in the Orinoco River basin of South America. These were the ancestors of Columbus's Tano hosts. What set them in motion is anybody's guess, but sometime after 2000 BCE they took to the sea, riding a branch of the South Equatorial Current along the northeast coast of South America, over the equator, to the base of the Antilles archipelago. Over the next two thousand years, they migrated up the archipelago from island to island, all the while appropriating cultural elements of the Stone Age peoples they displaced. By the late first century BCE, they had arrived at Hispaniola, where Tano civilization reached its zenith several centuries before Columbus. The Tano first crossed the Windward Passage from Hispaniola to eastern Cuba around 700 CE. There their westward progress stalled, their assimilative powers outmatched by the guns, germs, and steel of the conquistadors.In the American imagination, Columbus's so-called discovery of America in 1492 represents a watershed second only to the birth of Christ. In the eyes of Columbus and his royal sponsors, the mission to the Orient was merely a logical extension of the <i>reconquista</i>, the centuries-old (and vastly expensive) effort to drive the Moors (and Jews) from Spain. Only in hindsight can the expulsion of the Moors in 1492 be taken for granted. At the time Columbus was charting his journey west, the success of that battle could hardly be assumed, and Spain's newly consolidated kingdom of Aragon and Castile wanted nothing so much as funds sufficient to finish the job. Promise of access to lucrative Oriental markets induced Castile's queen Isabella to sponsor an audacious navigator from Genoa.11On the Iberian Peninsula, the rise of Aragon and Castile was achieved by the creation of what were in effect colonies established in the wake of the retreating Moors. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella granted rights to their most trusted and valued lieutenants to rule over these new colonies in their names. But there were only so many such grants to be won at home, and after 1492 the <i>Orbe Novo</i> beckoned to a cohort of second-tier conquistadors flush from the heat of battle, no less ambitious for fame and fortune, and no less committed to the project of making the world safe for Christianity than the royal favorites themselves. Columbus was more sailor than warrior, but warriorsaccompanied him on his several voyages to the Americas, where violence became the Spaniards' stock-in-trade.12Columbus's brief sojourn at Guantnamo signaled the beginning of a cataclysmic social and economic revolution that permanently transformed not only Cuba and Hispaniola but North and South America, Europe, and Africa besides. The islands and continents that Columbus and his successors "discovered" at the end of the fifteenth century were worthless without a labor force. Spain was merely the first in a series of aspiring European and North American empires that defended the enslavement and annihilation of millions of indigenous inhabitants and imported Africans on the basis of putative cultural and racial differences. The contradiction between the universalism latent in Western theology and philosophy and the West's historic treatment of Indians, slaves, and countless "others" inspired a long argument about just who was fit to be counted as a "human being," an argument that continues to this day (women? indigenous Americans? African slaves? stateless enemy combatants?). But all of this was unimaginable upon that first encounter at Guantnamo Bay.13&nbsp;<br>No doubt Columbus's impatience at Guantnamo Bay suited the Tano hunters just fine. With the admiral on his way to China, they were free to complete the task that had brought them to the bay. Compared with their cousins on Hispaniola, they had gotten off easily that day. At Isabella, Columbus's headquarters across the Windward Passage, the psychological and physical demands of conquest had begun to take a toll on the Europeans, with one of the first formal incidents of Spanish-on-Tano violence recorded earlier that same month.14 A local Indian had allegedly stolen a Spaniard's clothes; as punishment, one of Columbus's lieutenants cut off the ear of a Tano vassal, taking into custody the responsible cacique and several members of his family. Columbus wanted to teach the Indians a lesson by cutting off all his prisoners' arms, but a Tano ally dissuaded him. Nevertheless, a precedent had been set, and over the course of the next twenty years, the Spanish so brutalized Hispaniola that within a single generation there remained scarcely any Tano left.Cuba, meanwhile, enjoyed what can only be called a grace period,its inhabitants going about their lives as if they could avoid their neighbors'fate simply by ignoring it.15 When Spain finally turned its attention to Cuba in 1511, it did so with brutal efficiency. To pacify Cuba, the Crown selected Diego Velzquez de Cullar, author of spectacular atrocities in the Spanish conquest of Hispaniola, including the burning alive of eighty-four Tano caciques assembled at the village of Xara-gua in autumn 1503.16 Velzquez arrived in Cuba with a vengeance, indeed, in hot pursuit of a cacique named Hatuey, who had fled across the Windward Passage rather than submit to Spanish authority--a capital offense.17By 1511 the Crown had introduced in Hispaniola a scheme of land and labor distribution called encomienda, a feudal system for the New World. By the terms of encomienda, Spanish colonists received land along with right to the labor of the Indians who dwelt upon it. Technically, the Indians owned the lots on which they lived, and if less than independent, they were not formally slaves. Until they ran away, that is, thus depriving the Spanish encomendero the means of making a living (and the Crown itself its reason for being in the New World). A Tano in flight from encomienda was for all intents and purposes a runaway slave, and no amount of hand-wringing by Bartolom de las Casas and a whole order of Dominican monks could alter his or her fate.18Hatuey landed in Cuba at Punta de Mais, just across the Windward Passage from today'...</p><h2>World of Plants Teacher Supplement</h2><p>This teacher supplement book provides an introduction on how to teach the curriculum, a supply list and answer key for each lesson, a resource guide containing suggested books, videos, and field trips, and a master supply list for God&#39;s Design for Life: The World of Plants.

But she's still uneasy at Khattak's tight-lipped secrecy when he asks her to look into Christopher Drayton's death. Drayton's apparently accidental fall from a cliff doesn't seem to warrant a police investigation, particularly not from Rachel and Khattak's team, which handles minority-sensitive cases. But when she learns that Drayton may have been living under an assumed name, Rachel begins to understand why Khattak is tip-toeing around this case. It soon comes to light that Drayton may have been a war criminal with ties to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.</p><p>If that's true, any number of people might have had reason to help Drayton to his death, and a murder investigation could have far-reaching ripples throughout the community. But as Rachel and Khattak dig deeper into the life and death of Christopher Drayton, every question seems to lead only to more questions, with no easy answers.

He was seated with hislegs folded beneath him on a prayer rug woven by his ancestors from<br>Peshawar. The worn red and gold strands were comforting; his fingers sought them out when he pressed his forehead to the floor. A moment later, his eyes traced them as his cupped palms offered the<br>final supplication. The Maghrib prayer was for Khattak a time of consolation where along with prayers for Muhammad, he asked for mercy upon his wife and forgiveness for the accident that had caused her death. A nightly ritual of grief relieved by the possibility of hope, it stretched across that most resonant band of time: twilight. The dying sun muted his thoughts, much as it subdued the colors of the <i>ja-namaz<br></i>beneath him. It was the discipline of the ritual that brought him comfort, the reason he rarely missed it. Unless he was on duty&#x2014;as he was tonight, when the phone call from Tom Paley disturbed his<br>concentration.</p> <p><br>He no longer possessed the hot-blooded certainties of youth that a prayer missed or delayed would bring about a concomitant judgment of sin. Time had taught him to view his faith through the prism of compassion: when ritual was sacrificed in pursuit of the very values it was meant to inspire, there could be no judgment, no sin. He took the phone call from Tom Paley midway through the prayer and finished up in its aftermath. Tom, the most respected historian at Canada&#x2019;s Department of Justice, would not have disturbed him on an evening when Khattak could just as easily have been off-roster unless the situation was urgent. CPS, the Community Policing Section that Khattak headed, was still fragile, barely a year into its existence. The ambit was deliberately vague because CPS was a fig leaf for the most problematic community relations issue of all&#x2014;Islam. A steady shift to the right in Canadian politics, coupled with the spectacular bungling of the Maher Arar terrorism case in 2002, had birthed a generation of activist lawyers who pushed back vigorously against what they called tainted multiculturalism. Maher Arar&#x2019;s saga of extraordinary rendition and torture had mobilized them, making front-page news for months and costing the federal government millions in compensation when Arar had been cleared of all links to terrorism. A hastily concocted Community Policing Section had been the federal government&#x2019;s response, and who better than Esa Khattak to head it? A second-generation Canadian Muslim, his career had seen him transition seamlessly from Toronto&#x2019;s homicide squad to national counterintelligence work at INSET, one of the Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams. CPS called on both skill sets. Khattak was a rising star with an inbuilt understanding of the city of Toronto&#x2019;s shifting demographic landscape. At CPS, he was asked to lend his expertise to sensitive police investigations throughout the country at the request of se nior investigating offi cers from any branch of government.</p> <p><br>The job had been offered to Khattak as a promotion, his acceptance of it touted as a public relations victory. Khattak had taken it because of the freedom it represented: the chance to appoint his own team, and as with INSET, the opportunity to work with partners at all levels of government to bring nuance and consideration to increasingly complex cases.</p> <p><br>And for other reasons he had never offered up for public scrutiny. His mandate was couched in generic terms: sensitivity training for police services, community support, and an alternative viewpoint in cases involving minorities, particularly Muslim minorities. Both he and his superiors understood the unspoken rationale behind the choice of a decorated INSET officer to head up CPS. If Khattak performed well, then greater glory to the city, province, and nation. If he ran into barriers from within the community as he pursued his coreligionists, no one could accuse the CPS of bias. Everyone&#x2019;s hands were clean.</p> <p><br>It didn&#x2019;t matter to Khattak that this was how he had been lured into the job by his former superintendent, Robert Palmer. He loved police work. It suited an analytical nature tempered by a long-simmering hunger for justice. And if he was being used, as indisputably he was, he was also prepared to enact his own vision for CPS. What flame-fanning bigots across the border would doubtlessly call community pandering, a fig-leaf jihad. Take anything a Muslim touched, add the word jihad to it, and immediately you produced something ugly and divisive. But Tom wasn&#x2019;t one of these. Chief historian at the Department of Justice, he was a gifted academic whose fatherly demeanor masked a passion for the truth as sharp and relentless as Khattak&#x2019;s own.</p> <p><br>He had called to ask Khattak to investigate the death of a Scarborough man named Christopher Drayton. There was no reason that CPS should have an interest in the man&#x2019;s death. He had fallen from a section of the Scarborough Bluffs known as the Cathedral. His death had been swift and certain with no evidence of outside interference. Khattak had pointed this out to his friend in measured tones, and<br>Tom had let him. When he&#x2019;d finished, Tom gave him the real reason for his call and the reason it encroached upon Khattak&#x2019;s jurisdiction. Khattak heard the worry and fear beneath Tom Paley&#x2019;s words.</p> <p>And into the remnants of Khattak&#x2019;s prayer intruded a series of recollections from his youth. Of news reports, hurriedly organized meetings and volunteer drives, followed too slowly by action. He saw<br>himself as a young man joining others in a circle around the flame at Parliament Hill. He absorbed the thick, despairing heat of that summer into his skin. His dark hair flattened against his head; he felt in that moment his own impotence. He listened to Tom&#x2019;s labored explanation, not liking the hitch in his friend&#x2019;s breath. When Tom came to the nature of his request, Khattak agreed. But his words were slow, weighted by the years that had passed since that summer. Still, he would do as asked.<br></p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go alone,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to look objective.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>Khattak took no offense at the phrasing. He knew the unspoken truth as well as Tom did.</p> <p><br><i>Because you can&#x2019;t be.</i></p> <p><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take Rachel.&#x201d; He had told Tom about his partner, Rachel Getty, before.</p> <p><br>&#x201c;You know her well enough to trust her?&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best officer I&#x2019;ve ever worked with.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s young.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>&#x201c;Not so young that she doesn&#x2019;t understand our work. And I find her perspective helps me.&#x201d;</p> <p><br>He meant it. But even as he said it he knew that he would work with Rachel as he had done in the past. Withholding a part of the truth, of himself, until he could see the world through the clear, discerning eyes that watched him with such trust.</p> <p><br>He knew he could turn to his childhood friend, Nathan Clare, for background on Drayton. Nate lived on the Bluff s and would understand why he&#x2019;d agreed to Tom&#x2019;s request. Nate would understand as<br>well the toll compliance would take. But Khattak&#x2019;s bond with Nate had long since been severed. It was a mistake to think Nate still knew him at all.<br></p> <p>He&#x2019;d meant the last words of his prayer to be a blessing asked for his family, in a space he tried to keep for himself, exchanging solitude for solace. Lately, he&#x2019;d come to accept that there was no separate<br>peace. His work, and the harshness of the choices he had made, bled into everything.</p> <p><br>He rose from his prayer rug to find that dusk had given way to dark. He thought of the tiny documents library in Ottawa with its overflowing shelves. He&#x2019;d spent most of that long-ago summer there, collecting evidence.</p> <p><br>And he remembered other words, other blessings to be sought with a premonition of ruin.</p> <p><i>They are going to burn us all.</i></p></p><h2>Commentary on the Lutheran Book of Worship: Lutheran Liturgy in Its Ecumenical Context</h2><p>Background on the development of Lutheran Book of Worship and its suggested usage.</p><p></p><h2>With God on Their Side: George W.

Indeed, Christian fundamentalists made up close to 40 percent of the president&#x2019;s electorate in 2004, and their turnout increased by some four million voters over 2000.</p><p>As Esther Kaplan shows in her richly detailed investigation, it&#x2019;s no wonder the Christian right voted for Bush in droves&#x2014;their loyal support in 2000 produced fantastic results. While organizations that offer abortion counseling and services or help to prevent HIV see their funds cut, church groups receive millions in federal dollars to promote sexual abstinence and marriage (provided, of course, it is heterosexual). Bush has appointed a Christian right dream team to the federal courts, dedicated to tearing down what one such judge calls &#x201c;the so-called separation of church and state. Religious zeal even shapes Bush&#x2019;s foreign policy, as Christian belief in the end times spurs the administration&#x2019;s support for hard-line policies in Israel.</p><p>A prescient study of the Christian right&#x2019;s growing political clout, <i>With God on Their Side</i> is essential reading for anyone concerned about America&#x2019;s direction.</p><br></p><p>Esther Kaplan is a radio and print journalist and a community activist.

From the inside it read <i>FEIHC</i>, or it would have, if the letters hadn&#x2019;t been backward. He tried pronouncing the word, decided he couldn&#x2019;t, and stopped thinking about it. On his desk was a glamour head shot of his ex-wife. He looked at it for a time, and decided not to think about that, either.</p><p>Molly Crane came from the front desk and opened the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Suit just called in,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s some kind of disturbance at the junior high school and he thinks you and I ought to come down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Girls involved?&#x201d; Jesse said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he wants me,&#x201d; Molly said.</p><p>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Jesse said. &#x201c;But why does he want me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the chief of police,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;Everybody wants you.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse glanced at Jenn&#x2019;s picture again.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Jesse said. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse stood, and clipped his gun to his belt.</p><p>&#x201c;Though you sure don&#x2019;t dress like a chief,&#x201d; Molly said.</p><p>Jesse was wearing a uniform shirt, blue jeans, Nikes, a dark blue Paradise police baseball hat, and a badge that said <i>Chief</i>. He tapped the badge.</p><p>&#x201c;I do where it counts,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s on the desk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Steve,&#x201d; Molly said.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Jesse said. &#x201c;You drive. No siren.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, damn,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;I never get to use the siren.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe when you make sergeant,&#x201d; Jesse said.</p><p>There were two Paradise police cruisers parked outside of the junior high school.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s in the other cruiser,&#x201d; Jesse said as they got out of the car.</p><p>&#x201c;Eddie Cox,&#x201d; Molly said. &#x201c;He and Suit have seven to eleven this week.&#x201d;</p><p>They walked into the school lobby, where a thick mill of parents was being held at bay by two Paradise cops. Most of the parents were mothers, with a scatter of fathers looking oddly out of place. When Jesse came in they all swarmed toward him, many of them speaking to him loudly.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the chief of police, are you gonna do something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want that woman arrested!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a goddamned child molester!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do about this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know what she did?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did they tell you what happened here?&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse ignored them.</p><p>He said to Molly, &#x201c;Keep them here.&#x201d;</p><p>Then he pointed at Suit and jerked his head down the hallway.</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Christianity</h2><p>An introduction to Christian beliefs and culture discusses the life and teachings of Jesus, the Gospels, divisions and sects within Christianity, and Christian life.</p><p></p><h2>One Dog and His Boy</h2><p>Eva Ibbotson's final masterpiece, a tale of a boy and dog who were meant to be together.<br><br>All Hal had ever wanted was a dog. "Never!" cries his mother. "Think of the mess, the scratch-marks, the puddles on the floor." But on the morning of Hal's 10th birthday, the unbelievable happens. He's allowed to choose a dog at Easy Pets, a rent-a-pet agency (a fact his parents keep from him). The moment he sees the odd-looking terrier, he knows he's found a friend for life. But no one tells Hal that Fleck must be returned. When Hal wakes up on Monday morning, Fleck is gone. If dog and boy are to stay together they'll have to run away. . . . From the renowned Eva Ibbotson comes a tale laced with humor and brimming over with heart, stunning in its beauty of the love of all things dog. <br></p><p>Eva was the author of twenty novels for children and adults. Her first was published in 1975, and her last is the joyous ONE DOG AND HIS BOY. Eva's books have been shortlisted for every major children&#x2019;s literary prize in the UK, and JOURNEY TO THE RIVER SEA won the Gold Smarties Award in 2001.<br><br><b>From <i>One Dog and His Boy</i></b> <p> That night, lying on the floor with Fleck curled up beside him, Hal was thinking. Often and often when you wanted something and then got it, it was a disappointment. But having a dog was completely different. He'd wanted it and wanted it and when it happened, it was even better than he'd thought it would be. He'd imagined some of it-the companionship and the warmth-but he didn't realize a dog would make you laugh so much, or that he would help you to make so many friends. </p><p> It was extraordinary too how much a dog made you see. The hollows in the oak tree... and the way the acorns sat so neatly in their cups . . . how the earth clagged together, so dark after rain... Hal hadn't even noticed that it had rained. </p><p> And how much he made you think. Fleck had found an iron grating over a drain when they went out in the afternoon. The drain had interested him so much that he'd lain down on his stomach, just looking and smelling and investigating, and Hal realized that he'd never before thought about what might live down there, in the black and evil-looking water. </p><p> Hal reached up to turn on his night-light, but Fleck was lying across his feet and Hal didn't want to disturb him. Anyway, he didn't need a night-light now; he had a protector and a friend.</p></p><h2>The discoverie of Witchcraft</h2><p><p>Remarkable 16th-century classic attempted to disprove existence of witches.

In this groundbreaking work, Kathleen Rowe explores how the unruly woman&#x2014;often a voluptuous, noisy, joke-making rebel or "woman on top"&#x2014;uses humor and excess to undermine patriarchal norms and authority.</p><p>At the heart of the book are detailed analyses of two highly successful unruly women&#x2014;the comedian Roseanne Arnold and the Muppet Miss Piggy. Putting these two figures in a deeper cultural perspective, Rowe also examines the evolution of romantic film comedy from the classical Hollywood period to the present, showing how the comedic roles of actresses such as Katharine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyck, and Marilyn Monroe offered an alternative, empowered image of women that differed sharply from the "suffering heroine" portrayed in classical melodramas.</p></p><p>Unruly women have been making a spectacle of themselves in film and on television from Mae West to Roseanne Arnold.

In <i>Addicted to Christ,</i> Helena Hansen provides an in-depth analysis of Pentecostal ministries in Puerto Rico that were founded&nbsp;and run by self-identified &#x201c;ex-addicts,&#x201d; ministries that are also widespread in poor Black and Latino neighborhoods in the U.S. mainland. Richly ethnographic, the book harmoniously melds Hansen&#x2019;s dual expertise in cultural anthropology and psychiatry. Through the stories of ministry converts, she examines key elements of&nbsp;Pentecostalism: mysticism, ascetic practice, and the idea of other-worldliness. She then reconstructs the ministries' strategies of&nbsp;spiritual victory over addiction: transformation techniques to build spiritual strength and authority through pain and discipline; cultivation of alternative masculinities based on male converts&#x2019; reclamation of domestic space; and radical rupture from a post-industrial &#x201c;culture of disposability.&#x201d; By contrasting the ministries&#x2019; logic of addiction with that of biomedicine, Hansen rethinks roads to recovery, discovering unexpected convergences with biomedicine while revealing the allure of street corner ministries.</p><p><p>"<i>Addicted to Christ&nbsp;</i>is an extraordinarily inspiring account of how addiction can meet with reinterpretation through a vision of Christian life imbued with moral meaning. Unforgettably, we learn how Puerto Ricans have overcome social disintegration and impoverishment by building social relationships based on mutual aid. Hansen&#x2019;s lively first person perspective makes this book not only a breakthrough in medical anthropology but also an anthropological page turner."&#x2014;Emily Martin, Author of&nbsp;<i>The Woman in the Body, Flexible Bodies, and Bipolar Expeditions: Mania and Depression in American Culture</i></p><p>"Hansen has written a deeply empathetic ethnography of the struggle for recovery from addiction in Puerto Rican Pentecostal drug recovery churches. With critical humility and solidarity she also draws from her own hospital-based psychiatric clinical service to produce a tour de force of critical engaged medical anthropology. Plumbing creatively and critically from within her multiple positionalities as a clinician, a social scientist, an African American woman, and the child of a powerful extended matriarchal family touched by the entangled traumas of oppression, mental illness and addiction she is advancing a creative new psychoanalytic and political economic theoretical understanding of gender power relations, family trauma, racialized colonial oppressions, the art of clinical practice and biomedical science, the potential for healing and spiritual social solidarity-- and the relentless brutality of contemporary neoliberalism."&#x2014;Philippe Bourgois, author of<i>&nbsp;In Search of Respect: Dealing Crack in El Barrio,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Righteous Dopefiend.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x201c;I enjoyed&nbsp;<i>Addicted to Christ</i>&nbsp;a great deal. It is well-written, innovative, salient and it has an important story to tell."&#x2014; Arthur Kleinman, MD, author of&nbsp;<i>Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture, The Illness Narratives, and What Really Matters.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Can one&#x2019;s relationship with God overcome the power of narcotics? Or is it necessary to use one drug to check another?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dualism that Dr. Helena Hansen leads us through, unpeeling the layers of lived experience until we can see the biosocial illness which requires that we bring many tools to the healing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a book to be read and treasured by doctors, patients, legislators &#x2013; everyone hoping to manage addiction and limit its dreadful toll on our society.&#x201d; &#x2014; Thompson Fullilove, author of&nbsp;<i>Urban Alchemy: Restoring Joy in America&#x2019;s Sorted-Out Cities</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is an important contribution to our understanding of addiction, as it bridges the fields of anthropology and psychiatry with remarkable insight and scholarship. It is remarkable in that it provides a humanistic approach, one that is so often lacking in how the medical field deals with this major public health problem."&#x2014;Marc Galanter, MD, Past President, American Society for Addiction Medicine, author of&nbsp;<i>Spirituality and the Healthy Mind.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x201c;In the midst of a national epidemic of addiction, Helena Hansen provides a timely and sobering tale of reality, recovery, and ultimately, hope. With enormous compassion for the communities involved in grassroots evangelical addiction ministries in Puerto Rico, she offers a clear and welcome challenge to single model solutions for addiction, while urging us to account for the larger political and economic conditions of postindustrial social disintegration and displacement that must be at the center of any multipronged recovery effort."&#x2014;Arlene D�vila, author of<i>&nbsp;Latinos Inc. and Barrio Dreams: Puerto Ricans, Latinos and the Neoliberal City</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Addicted to Christ&nbsp;</i>is a passionately written scholarly contribution to important debates about the causes of and cures for drug addiction. Helena Hansen uses both her personal experiences and her knowledge of&nbsp; medicine and culture to weave a narrative of the personal journeys and social implications of Pentecostal addiction treatment centers.&#x201d;&#x2014;Margarita Mooney, author of&nbsp;<i>Faith Makes Us Live: Surviving and Thriving in the Haitian Diaspora</i></p><p>"This is a fabulous and unique book that marks an excellent contribution to medical anthropology, public health, religion, gender, and Latin American and Caribbean studies."&#x2014;Carolyn Rouse, author of&nbsp;<i>Televised Redemption: Black Religious Media and Racial Empowerment</i></p><br><b>Helena Hansen, MD, PhD&nbsp;</b>is Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at New York University.</p><h2>How To Use Adapt &amp; Design Sewing Pattern</h2><p>A guide to getting the most from sewing patterns, from choosing the right size to translating flat shapes into wearable garments.

That is, until a dragon destroys her castle, burns all her clothes and carries off her prince! But Elizabeth&#39;s not easily beaten and sets off to get Ronald back.</p><p>Elizabeth, a beautiful princess, lives in a castle and wears fancy clothes. Just when she is about to marry Prince Ronald, a dragon smashes her castle, burns her clothes with his fiery breath, and prince-naps her dear Ronald. Undaunted and presumably unclad, she dons a large paper bag and sets off to find the dragon and her cherished prince. Once she's tracked down the rascally reptile, she flatters him into performing all sorts of dragonly stunts that eventually exhaust him, allowing her to rescue Prince Ronald. But what does Prince Not-So-Charming say when he sees her? "You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess." (At least he has the courtesy not to mention that the princess's crown resembles a dying sea anemone.) In any case, let's just say that Princess Elizabeth and Prince Ronald do not, under any circumstances, live happily ever after.

Using the framework of the Hebrew Calendar, synchronized with the Julian Calendar, the true chronology of Jesus&#39; life has been accurately depicted. The Scriptural and chronological facts reveal that Jesus was born in the fall of 5 BC, not on December 25 in 1 AD. He was crucified on the Passover day in the spring of 30 AD, and His body was in the tomb for three days and three nights, a full 72 hours. He was resurrected at the end of the weekly Sabbath, not at sunrise on Easter Sunday. Graphically illustrated charts simplify chronological events, and the book has complete topical and Scriptural indices.</p><p><b>Fred R. Coulter Minister, Author and Publisher</b><p> With a ministry now spanning 44 years, Fred Coulter is on a God-inspired mission to preserve the truth of God for the next generation of faithful Christians. According to Coulter, secular-liberal, New Age-satanic forces are fast at work corrupting the fundamental truths of the Bible and destroying godly morality. Additionally, prominent atheists in America and the UK have mounted bitter assaults against God and the Bible. In fact, Christianity itself is experiencing rampant doctrinal confusion and heresy, resulting in the overthrow of bedrock moral values. Even the Scriptures themselves are no longer held as sacred, but have been thoroughly violated in the rush to produce so-called modern gender-neutral translations.</p><p> It is against this backdrop that Coulter has worked as minister, author and publisher to produce nine biblical books, an abundance of booklets and papers, 1600 audio sermons, and 400 video sermon--all designed to safeguard the true doctrines of Christ, as well as the Scriptures themselves. Recent publications include Occult Holidays or Gods Holy Days--Which?, now in its second edition. A much-needed resource for Bible students, this book contrasts the pagan holidays of nominal Christianity with the God-ordained holy days of the Bible. In July of 2008, Coulters work reached a personal milestone with the first printing of The Holy Bible In Its Original Order--A Faithful Version With Commentary. This new English translation is an easy-to-read rendering of the Old and New Testaments and is completely faithful to the original texts--including their original manuscript order.</p><p> Coulter has also developed in-depth Web sites for the purpose of preserving biblical truth (cbcg.org and biblicaltruthministries.org). Over a thousand audio sermons and Bible studies are available for download, including numerous sermon transcripts and biblical articles. Commentaries, histories and chronologies are also available.</p><p> <b>Education</b> Coulter graduated from San Mateo State College and attended the University of San Francisco before graduating from Ambassador University, Pasadena, CA, with a BA in Theology in 1964. Coulter completed advanced biblical and ministerial studies from 1972-75 under the Ambassador University Master s Program.</p><p> <b>Translating the New Testament</b> After completing formal instruction in NT Greek, Coulter continued to expand his knowledge of Greek for the next 20 years by undertaking a verse-by-verse study of the books of the New Testament using the Byzantine Text. In the course of his study, he was moved to translate the Gospel accounts into clear, easy-to-read English for contemporary reader--resulting in his first published work, A Harmony of the Gospels in Modern English (now in its third edition). Ultimately, Coulter was inspired to translate the entire New Testament. After twelve years of translating, The New Testament In Its Original Order--A Faithful Version With Commentary was completed and published in 2004.</p><p> <b>Ministerial Career</b> Ordained as a minister of Christ in 1965, Coulter has served as pastor of several Sabbath-keeping churches in the Pacific Northwest, the Mountain States, the Los Angeles area and the central coast area of California. Since 1983, Coulter has served as pastor of the Christian Biblical Church of God (CBCG), headquartered in Hollister, California (cbcg.org).</p><p> <b>Major Publications</b> <i>The Holy Bible In Its Original Order</i> <i>The New Testament In Its Original Order</i> <i>A Harmony of the Gospels In Modern English</i> <i>Occult Holidays or Gods Holy Days Which?</i> <i>God s Plan for Mankind Revealed by His Sabbath and Holy Days</i> <i>The Christian Passover</i> <i>The Day Jesus the Christ Died</i> <i>The Seven General Epistles</i> <i>Lord, What Should I Do?</i></p></p><h2>Lequeu: An Architectural Enigma</h2><p>"Jean-Jacques Lequeu does in fact hide behind the most enigmatic and controversial smile in the history of art," writes Philippe Duboy in a book that is one of the most tantalizing examples of architectural investigation ever produced.<br> <br> It is an extraordinary compilation - part speculative biography, part meticulous research, with hundreds of intriguing drawings, many in color - that unravels the mystery of this eighteenth-century maverick artist whose drawings have established him variously as a visionary architect associated with Boull�e and Ledoux, forerunner of surrealism, and inventor of bad taste.<br> <br> Lequeu's architectural drawings from the legendary portfolios <i>Architecture civile</i> and <i>Nouvelle methode</i> are presented here in their entirety, along with his "Lewd Figures," perhaps the oddest feature of the whole collection. The drawings are accompanied by long captions, misspelt and ungrammatical, but written in a flawless bureaucratic hand. The artist's marginalia provide insights into his visions, which seem dominated by an obsession with petrified forms and a recurring preoccupation with sex. Interleaved with the drawings are curious autobiographical papers. And it is here that Duboy's investigation of Lequeu begins to reveal strange clues.<br> <br> He discovers that Lequeu was not an architect at all but a government bureaucrat, a draftsman who ended up living in a brothel. Between the brothel and the obscure office from which he was eventually fired, he produced his "encyclopedia of the universe" - bizarre portraits of nuns baring their breasts and other lewd figures, and architectural fantasies of vast imaginary cities.<br> <br> Duboy takes his study further, into the realm of Charles Fourier and his brother-in-law Anthelme Brillat-Savarin and from there to the world of the dadaists, surrealists, and futurists, particularly the circles of Marcel Duchamp and Le Corbusier. He suggests that Duchamp and Raymond Rousell tampered with the Lequeu drawings to concoct a character and oeuvre even more puzzling. There are glimpses of Duchamp's convolutions of mind that will stir a reassessment of his work. "Duchamp emerges here, for the first time, as an intrepid and unwavering despiser of Le Corbusier. Twentieth-century reputations are as much at stake in this study as those of the eighteenth-century artist," notes Robin Middleton.<br> <br> Philippe Duboy is Professor of the History of Cities, Paris-Belleville School of Architecture.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchA very complex and provoking book about an architect rightly called an engima. Lequeu (1757-1820?) is known chiefly through his donation of drawings and manuscripts to the Bibliotheque Nationale; these included Architecture civile and Nouvelle methode , here published in their entirety. Duboy suggests that the Lequeu papers may have been altered or fabricated by Marcel Duchamp for the purpose of attacking LeCorbusier. The book is dense and hard to follow, without a clear structure, clear scholarly apparatus, or clear conclusion, although perhaps none is possible. Layout and design are lavish, but not always well done; many plates reproducing manuscript pages are not clear, and there are some misprints. For specialists in surrealism and architectural history.

Summary; This man could plainly do for mathematics what Brian Cox has done for physics&#34;. (Sunday Times). How does a genius see the world? Where and how does inspiration strike? Cedric Villani takes us on a mesmerising adventure as he wrestles with the Boltzmann equation - a new theorem that will eventually win him the most coveted prize in mathematics and a place in the mathematical history books. Along the way he encounters obstacles and setbacks, losses of faith and even brushes with madness. His story is one of courage and partnership, doubt and anxiety, elation and despair. Of ordinary family life blurring with the abstract world of mathematical physics, of theories and equations that haunt your dreams and seeking the elusive inspiration found only in a locked, darkened room. Blending science with history, biography with myth, Villani conjures up an inimitable cast: the omnipresent Einstein, mad genius Kurt Godel, and Villani&#39;s personal hero, John Nash.

He has been killed by his second wife, Winnette, whose naive and winsome ways are a concern to her friend and co-worker at the jeans factory, Mavis, who had been Plover's first wife. Mavis wonders anxiously about Winnette, "What if she made a gentleman of Plover? What if he came to be dependable and sober?" It turns out, however, that all of Plover's ugly traits--drug using and -running, sadism--were revealed in his brief, explosive marriage to Winnette. At the trial, we hear unabashedly from everyone--judge, jury, court psychiatrist, Mavis, as well as Winnette--and find that the defendant's very special appeal makes the hard-won verdict ring true. A wealth of humor and underlying rue distinguish this entertaining novel, developed through alternating viewpoints, and accurately reflecting Southern voices and sensibilities. Ehle ( Last One Home ) has a deft touch, a sure grasp of character and, here, a diverting story. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.In some mountain coves of North Carolina, "for better or for worse" still means just that. Winnette knew Ernest Lloyd Plover to be a hard-drinking, drug-pushing, gun-carrying, abusive man before she married him, didn't she? Then she shot him dead in self-defense--or premeditated murder. Her trial proceeds through the testimony of witnesses and the pronouncements of the crotchety judge, the rookie DA, and the retired lawyer court-appointed to defend her. No Perry Mason antics here; just plain mountain people trying to arrive at justice. Characterizations are strong, the descriptions of wife abuse even more so.

Peretti</strong> is one of American Christianity's best-known authors. His novels have sold over 10 million copies, and he is widely credited with reinventing Christian fiction. He and his wife, Barbara, live in the Pacific Northwest. www.frankperetti.com.</p>This sequel to Peretti's This Present Darkness is built upon fundamentalist Christian ideas. As it tells the story of Sally Roe, who goes from spiritualism to conversion, it also traces a battle to save a Christian school from demon-inspired litigation. The human activities are again overshadowed by the battle between angels and demons, whom the author takes quite literally, giving them names, personalities, and dialogue. They influence all human activities, just as human prayer helps angels and hampers demons. Some readers may find this treatment religiously offensive or react negatively to the book's depiction of liberals. But this is a good story, and it offers insight into the kind of religion that sees demons behind every stump and angels in the hen house. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- C.

From Joseph Pennell&#39;s praise in &#34;A New Illustrator&#34; in 1893, through the fusillade aimed at &#34;The Yellow Book,&#34; the eulogies of Beerbohm, Ross, and Symons, the turn-of-the-century listings of Vallance and Gallatin, R. A. Walker&#39;s miscellanies spanning the teens through the forties, the 1966 Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition catalogue and Brian Reade&#39;s subsequent book, to recent biographies and critical studies, there is a seemingly endless Beardsley literature. One result of this plethora of books, monographs, and articles, some of them disorganized, if not contradictory or confusing, is that no single source of reliable information exists, the kind of guide a collector, a curator, or a bookseller would want to keep handy. &#34;A Selective Checklist of the Published Work of Aubrey Beardsley&#34; aims to fill that need. Based on examination of public and private collections, recent scholarship, and archival materials, this book, the first bibliography to be published in half a century, resolves long-standing ambiguities, corrects oft-repeated errors, and provides a wealth of new information. It lists most of the books and periodicals containing Beardsley&#39;s illustrations, drawings, designs, bindings, and writings published during his lifetime, along with posthumously issued items of significance. Posters, bookplates, and ephemera are also described, and there is a section dealing with forgeries and misattributions. An extensive index and cross-references to previous (often unindexed) standard sources are provided, making &#34;A Selective Checklist&#34; an essential resource for all interested in Beardsley and the British 1890s. Mark Samuels Lasner is a recognized authority on late Victorian art and literature. A collector and bibliographer, he is author of &#34;William Allingham: A Bibliographical Study&#34; (1993) and co-author, with Margaret D.

In 1986, Colfer became a Primary School teacher, but continued to write in his free time.Grade 5-8&#x2013;No, this is not a sequel to the previous titles; it's a companion book. It includes two original short stories, one a prequel to <i>Artemis Fowl</i> (the first) about Captain Holly Short and how she became a member of the LEP, and the other a story about Artemis looking for the Fei Fei Tiara (Seventh Dwarf). In it, readers see Mulch working with Artemis for the first time. There are also games; readers can practice fairy code, learn the gnomish alphabet, do a crossword puzzle or a find-a-word (the latter may cause problems in libraries). Finally, they can read interviews with Artemis, Captain Short, Butler, Mulch Diggums, Foaly, Commander Root, and the author. With the write-in caveat in mind, this volume will give all of those Fowler fans something to read while waiting for the next book.<i>&#x2013;Saleena L.

It is the inner thread of this amazing book that makes it a world classic: the tales and events mirror the antics of the human mind in its way through life. The last chapter where the &#34;rascal,&#34; after all his experiences, settles down to a devout Sufi life, gives the clue to this fascinating textbook of traditional psychology.</p><p>Al-Hariri of Basra (1054-1122) is variously described as a silk merchant, a high official of the Seljuk monarch Malik Shah, and the author of The Assemblies, regarded for eight centuries as the greatest treasure in Arabic literature after the Koran.</p><h2>Bodies and Pleasures: Foucault and the Politics of Sexual Normalization</h2><p><p>Sexual identities are dangerous, Michel Foucault tells us. Categories of desire harden into stereotypes by which the forces of normalization hold us and judge us. In Bodies and Pleasures, Ladelle McWhorter reads Foucault from an original and personal angle, motivated by the differences this experience has made in her life. At the same time, her analysis advances discussion of key issues in Foucault scholarship: the genealogical critique, the status of the subject and humanism, essentialism versus social construction, and the relationships between identity, community, and political action. Weaving her own experience of coming to grips with her lesbian sexual identity into her readings of Foucault's most recent writings on sexuality and power, McWhorter argues compellingly that Foucault's texts should be read less for the arguments they advance and more for their transformative effect. By exploring bodies and pleasures&#x2015;gardening, line dancing, or doing philosophy, for example&#x2015;McWhorter shows that it isn't necessary to conform with socially recognized sexual identities. Bodies and Pleasures takes the reader beyond unexplored norms and imposed identities as it points the way toward a personal politics, ethics, and style that challenges our sexual selves.</p></p><p><p>Ladelle McWhorter is Associate Professor of<br>Philosophy and Women's Studies and Chair of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Richmond.

He has enjoyed particular success in his award-winning picture book collaborations with Julia Donaldson, but is also the best-selling illustrator of novelty books such as THE BEDTIME BEAR (1 405 04993 6).PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;In this sequel to <i>The Gruffalo</i> (Dial, 1999), the wide-eyed daughter of that story's title character decides to find the "Big Bad Mouse" that her father has told her so much about. "His eyes are like pools of terrible fire,/and his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire." With her stick doll tucked under her arm, the youngster enters the deep, dark woods and follows marks in the snow to snake, owl, and fox. When she finally finds a little mouse, she grabs him for a feast, but the clever creature tricks her into running away to the comfort of her sleeping father's arms. The full-color cartoons portray a suitably sympathetic child in the snow-filled woods. While children may appreciate the details (the stick doll, snake tracks in the snow, gruffalo child's cave drawings) in the art, lack of change from picture to picture and in perspective diminish its effectiveness. The plot, rhymes, and art are all slightly weaker than the original tale.

COUNTING ON GRACE is an excellent historical novel inspired by the real-life photograph of a mill child taken by child labor activist Lewis Hines. Grace is a wide-eyed girl who wants so much to help her family earn more money, to learn to read with her teacher on Sundays, and ultimately to become a teacher; and that enthusiasm and frustration are faithfully translated. Another highlight is Gamache's interpretation of Grace's mother as a proud French-Canadian mill worker and a force to be reckoned with.

In the search for the &#34;&#34;mystery&#34;&#34; in which things and organisms are enveloped, Magritte created pictures which, taking everyday reality as their starting point, were to follow a different logic from that to which we are accustomed. Magritte depicts the world of reality in such unsecretive superficiality that the beholder of his pictures is forced to reflect that the mystery of it is not evoked by some sentimental transfiguration, but rather by the logic of his thoughts and associations. Magritte thus invented an inimitable pictorial language which he uses to question our usual comprehension of pictures. In this book, Jacques Meuris traces Magritte&#39;s artistic development from its beginnings until the end of his life, and in doing so underlines the originality of this great Belgian Surrealist.</p><p>Jacques Meuris is a writer, photographer, and art critic; he is the author of numerous books, catalogue articles and commentaries on modern art, literature and photography.

Will Seth, Ollie, and their horse (who&#x2019;s really a dog named Shasta) be able to resist the dangers of dog-eating bog frogs, fire-breathing bats, elephant ants, and invisible voices to save the day?</p><p>RICHARD THAKE comes to children's publishing as a veteran of the advertising business; he was an Associate Creative Director of one of Canada&#x2019;s largest advertising agencies. A father of three grown children and a grandfather of three, he has finally found the time to write the Sir Seth series - a thinly disguised glimpse into his own &#x201c;theater of the mind&#x201d; childhood adventures with his friends in the Don River Valley and The Beach areas of Toronto. He lives in Newcastle, ON.Gr 3-5&#x2013;Seth Thislethwaite and Ollie Everghettz are typical 10-year-old boys, but in their minds, they are Sir Seth and Sir Ollie, Mighty Knights of Right &amp; Honor. One summer day, their imaginations take them on an extraordinary adventure in the evil kingdom of High Dudgeon. Sir Shawn Shrood's soothsaying shoes have been stolen, and the boys are charged with the daunting task of retrieving them. The children are determined to succeed, as it's not just the soothsaying shoes that are at stake&#x2013;the fate of High Dudgeon also hangs in the balance. Thake bases his book on a noble premise&#x2013;the idea that imagination is better than any video game or television show. The writing style, comprised primarily of Seussian tongue twisters, is also a well-intentioned attempt to make the book appealing to emerging readers. However, it falls short on many fronts. Most notably, readers come away with the feeling that most plot elements are pulled out of the blue (for example, the need to illuminate a dark passageway is met with the convenient introduction of fire-breathing bats). The cartoon illustrations, though numerous, are only adequate. Furthermore, the idea that the villains only desire friendship and acceptance is clich�d and unsatisfying. And while the writing style may seem novel and fun at first, reading a whole book full of tongue twisters and wordplay may only serve to frustrate some readers.&#x2013;Amy Holland, Irondequoit Public Library, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2010.

Maybe Mab was the fury. Maybe she was the courage. Maybe later on she was the sex . . .<br></p><p>A tiny fairy winging her way through the jasmine-scented L.A. night. A little girl caught in a grown-up glitz-and-glitter world of superstars and supermodels. A too beautiful boy with a secret he can never share . . .</p><p>From the author of <em>Weetzie Bat</em> comes a magical, mesmerizing tale of transformation. This is the story of Barbie Marks, who dreams of being the one behind the Cyclops eye of the camera, not the voiceless one in front of it; who longs to run away to New York City where she can be herself, not some barley flesh-and-blood version of the plastic doll she was named after. It is the story of Griffin Tyler, whose androgynous beauty hides the dark pain he holds inside. And finally it is the story of Mab, a pinkie-sized, magenta-haired, straight-talking fairy, who may or may not be real but who helps Barbie and Griffin uncover the strength beneath the pain, and who teaches that love&#x2014;like a sparkling web of light spinning around our bodies and our souls&#x2014;is what can heal even the deepest scars.</p></p><p>Once upon a time, in the bubble-gum-snapping, glitter polish-wearing, lip-gloss-applying San Fernando Valley, a gentle girl named Barbie met a feisty fairy named Mab: "Maybe Mab was real. Maybe there really are girls the size of pinkies with hair the color of the darkest red oleander blossoms and skin like the greenish-white underbellies of calla lilies.... But it doesn't matter if Mab is real or imagined, Barbie thought, as long as I can see her." Mab, with her crabby commentary and no-holds-barred opinions, gives Barbie the strength she needs to face the horrors casting a shadow over her life in sunny, shimmering California. How else could Barbie survive her over-perfumed, over-tanned, overbearing stage mother, dragging her daughter to modeling agencies in the gold-plated hope of reliving her younger days as a beauty queen? Or the "cadaver-pale skin" and "fleshy mouth" of Hamilton Waverly, the "crocodile pedophile" photographer who makes Barbie feel "like the doll she had been named for, without even a hole where her mouth was supposed to be"? Mab glimmers and gabs by Barbie's side throughout her teen years as she becomes a successful fashion model, falls in love, and endures all the troubles that come along for the ride--in addition to facing the black secret of her past.<p> Francesca Lia Block, author of the magical Weetzie Bat books that are collected in <i>Dangerous Angels</i>, and the empowering, punchy <i>Girl Goddess #9</i>, has once again crafted a mystical tale whose ethereal, original language will wrap readers in its gossamer grip.

In this latest effort, he opts for broad farce that, like his cartoon style, is reminiscent of the Marx Brothers or Monty Python. He interweaves text and cartoons, which are used to good effect, not just as illustrations of what the reader already knows but as an extension of the text. Eddy Deco is a '40s type P.I. in the Sam Spade tradition, who is hired by Tracy McEstings to find her missing husbanda minor hoodand finds himself involved in a ludicrous caper that gets zanier as the story develops. Eddy's search leads him to underground caverns and Chinese torturers, Damon Runyonesque hoods and villains who have a disconcerting habit of turning into giant crabs or squids. Readers who don't take their P.I. literature too seriously, and who enjoy a touch of the absurd in their humor, will find Gahan's latest to their taste. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Digging for Carter&#39;s Grove (Colonial Williamsburg Archaeological Series, No. 8)</h2><p>As a preliminary step toward re-creating as nearly as possible a working eighteenth-century plantation at Carter&#39;s Grove on the James River near Williamsburg, some two years of archaeological work has been devoted to the areas surrounding the great house.

He has illustrated many children's books and has already finished "'The Crunching Munching Caterpillar"' - the sequel to "'The Very Lazy Ladybug."' Jack lives in Somerset, England with his wife and child.PreSchool-Grade 1-The ladybug of the title is so lethargic that she doesn't even know how to fly. She decides to look for a new sleeping spot, and, since her mobility is restricted, she latches on to a number of passing animals. As she soon finds out, a kangaroo is too bouncy, a monkey's incessant swinging makes her dizzy, and a tiger's roaring makes it too noisy to sleep. Finally, she thinks she's found the perfect spot-on the trunk of an elephant. However, the elephant sneezes and the ladybug is launched into the air and has to fly at last. The illustrations are done in bold, eye-catching colors, and the animals are very simply drawn and easily recognizable. The variety in the type reflects the action and movement of the animals. Children will enjoy acting out the tale as the ladybug looks for a quiet place to sleep.

He thinks he is merely visiting one of the local sights when he takes a party to visit the Oracle of the Dead, a pre-Roman cult site located at the end of a tunnel dug beneath a temple of Apollo. He quickly learns that there is a bitter&nbsp;rivalry between the priests of Apollo and those of Hecate, who guard the oracle.<br>When the priests of Apollo are all killed, the countryside looks to explode in violence as Greeks, Romans and native Italians of several conquered nations bring out old enmities.&nbsp; Decius is caught squarely in the middle, desperate to find a way out that will pacify the district and, incidentally, save&nbsp;his own skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;This riveting series began with the Edgar Award-nominated SPQR and&nbsp;has gone on to international success in 13 languages.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>John Maddox Roberts is the author of several science fiction, private eye, and fantasy novels, in addition to his popular SPQR mystery series.

Recently raised to the post of <i>praetor peregrinus</i>, Metellus is enjoying traveling outside Rome hearing cases involving foreigners, but he gets an unexpected shock at the Oracle of the Dead near the southern Italian town of Baiae. The corpse of Eugaeon, a priest of Apollo, surfaces in the rushing stream of water inside the oracle's temple. Oddly, Eugaeon's body shows no sign of violence but is completely hairless. After the priest's missing colleagues, initially the prime suspects, also turn up dead, the astute sleuth comes to believe that these current killings are but the latest of many. Metellus puts his own life at risk in an exciting case that engages the attention of Pompey himself. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But in every age and in every place drunkenness is a little bit different. It can be religious, it can be sexual, it can be the duty of kings or the relief of peasants. It can be an offering to the ancestors, or a way of marking the end of a day&#39;s work. It can send you to sleep, or send you into battle. A Short History of Drunkenness traces humankind&#39;s love affair with booze from our primate ancestors through to Prohibition, answering every possible question along the way: What did people drink? How much? Who did the drinking? Of the many possible reasons, why? On the way, learn about the Neolithic Shamans, who drank to communicate with the spirit world (no pun intended), marvel at how Greeks got giddy and Romans got rat-arsed, and find out how bars in the Wild West were never quite like in the movies. This is a history of the world at its inebriated best.</p><p>Born in London in 1977, Mark Forsyth (a.k.a The Inky Fool) was given a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary as a christening present and has never looked back. His book The Etymologicon was a Sunday Times Number One Bestseller and his TED Talk &#39;What&#39;s a snollygoster?&#39; has had more than half a million views. He has also written a specially commissioned essay &#39;The Unknown Unknown&#39; for Independent Booksellers Week and the introduction for the new edition of the Collins English Dictionary. He lives in London with his dictionaries, and blogs at blog.inkyfool.com.My favourite book of this and possibly any other Christmas is Mark Forsyth&#39;s A Short History of Drunkenness -- Marcus Berkmann * The Spectator * Forsyth&#39;s jokes are snappy and well delivered. Unlike most comical writers he never falls into the trap of confusing long-windedness with irony -- Craig Brown * Mail on Sunday * Haha! . . . Highly suitable for Xmas! -- Margaret Atwood This entertaining study of drunkenness makes for a racy sprint through human history -- Christopher Hart * Sunday Times * A brisk and brilliant romp through our hiccoughing history, drenched with wit. Bloody marvellous from first sip to last burp -- Jason Hazeley, co-author of the Ladybird series (including &#39;The Ladybird Book of the Quiet Night In&#39; and &#39;The Ladybird Book of the Hangover&#39; Reading like a TED talk delivered by a stand-up comedian, this made me laugh out loud more than my first ever night out on absinthe. As essential as a hip flask or a pack of pork scratchings for any true connoisseur of booze. A Short History of Drunkenness is this year&#39;s Chateauneuf-du-Pape of Christmas books, no less. Bloody entertaining. -- Emlyn Rees, author of &#39;The Very Hungover Caterpillar&#39; and &#39;We&#39;re Going on a Bar Hunt&#39; Sometimes you see a book title that simply gladdens the heart. Everyone I showed this book to either smiled broadly or laughed out loud . . . This is a book of some brilliance - probably best consumed with a restorative glass of something by your side. -- Marcus Berkmann * Daily Mail * As Mark Forsyth brilliantly shows, civilisation is built on booze. Egypt (beer), Greece and Rome (wine) depended on alcohol to create their mighty works. Where man drinks, he prospers, and vice versa. A toast to this spirits-fuelled spirits-lifter. Staggering! -- Harry Mount, editor of the Oldie I thought I knew quite a bit about drinking but A Short History of Drunkenness made me look at inebriation anew. Each chapter amazed, challenged and stimulated me so much that I needed a stiff drink at the end of it. -- Henry Jeffreys, author of Empire of Booze This charming book proved so engrossing that while reading it I accidentally drank two bottles of wine without realising. -- Rob Temple, author of Very British Problems Everything we ever thought about Christmas is wrong! Great stuff -- Matthew Parris on &#39;A Christmas Cornucopia&#39; Mark Forsyth wears his considerable knowledge lightly. He also writes beautifully -- David Marsh, on &#39;The Elements of Eloquence&#39; * Guardian * This year&#39;s must-have stocking filler ... the essential addition to the library in the smallest room is Mark Forsyth&#39;s The Etymologicon -- Ian Sansom * Guardian * Mark imparts knowledge about Christmas traditions from the essential to the (very) abstruse in wry and sardonic style. An effortless and enjoyable way to learn more about this fulcrum of our calendar -- Paul Smiddy, Former Head of pan-European retail research, HSBC, on &#39;A Christmas Cornucopia&#39; With his casual elegance and melodious voice, Mark Forsyth has an anachronistic charm totally at odds with the 21st century * Sunday Times South Africa on&#39;The Horologicon&#39; * [The Etymologicon is] a perfect bit of stocking filler for the bookish member of the family, or just a cracking all-year-round-read. Highly recommended * The Spectator * As good as promised - could have been thrice as long -- Ben Schott, on &#39;The Elements of Eloquence&#39; Witty and revelatory. Blooming brilliant -- Raymond Briggs on &#39;A Christmas Cornucopia&#39;</p><h2>I, Q (Star Trek The Next Generation)</h2><p>In a story told by the actor who played &#34;Q&#34; in the popular TV series, the mischievous super-being joins forces with his nemesis, Captain Picard, to save the universe. Tour.</p><p>As fans of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> know, Q is the omnipotent extradimensional entity who so often causes whimsical havoc on the <i>Starship Enterprise</i> and elsewhere--for example, by helpfully introducing Captain Picard and his crew to the menacing Borg collective. Now this petulant demigod's first-person story is told by John de Lancie, the actor who plays Q, and Peter David, author of successful <i>Star Trek</i> novels. It's an irreverent romp through one bizarre scenario after another, as not only <i>Star Trek</i>'s Federation universe but the entire multiverse of alternative timelines looks set to gurgle down a metaphysical plughole. Q's own wife and son vanish into the maelstrom, and his "Q Continuum" colleagues blither about calmly accepting apocalypse as a change from eternal tedium. Only Picard and Data the android accompany the questing Q, whose monstrous egotism and complaints that Picard never genuflects to him are barely affected when he loses his godlike powers and realizes that he may <i>need</i> mere humans. En route to the end of all things, they encounter other Federation characters, including Romulans, Klingons, Ferengi, and our captain's dread cyborg alter-ego, Locutus of Borg. After a fast-moving sequence of fights, wisecracks, insults, old jokes, and ultimate despair, the fate of the multiverse is ... but that would be telling. Frothy entertainment. <i>--David Langford</i><b>John de Lancie</b> brought Q to life in the very first episode of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation�</i> and has since appeared as Q in numerous episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine�</i> and <i>Star Trek: Voyager�.</i> He has also starred on such series as <i>Legend</i> and <i>Days of Our Lives,</i> and collaborated with Leonard Nimoy on the "Alien Voices" audiobook series.</p><h2>Dark Nature: A Natural History of Evil</h2><p>Redefining good and evil in biological terms, the author of Supernature explains how the evil that exists in our world can be controlled, drawing on research in psychology, ecology, anthropology, and genetics to examine the biological realities of evil. $30,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Lyall Watson was born in South Africa and educated there and in Britain, taking his Ph. D. at London University in 1963. He had a vast and varied career; he was involved in anthropology in Jordan, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil; archaeological excavations in Israel, Turkey and Peru; palaeontology in South and East Africa; marine biology in the Indian Ocean; botany in the deserts of Sonora; medical research in the Philippines; and represented the Seychelles on the International Whaling Commission. He spent years pursuing the paranormal and published many important works in the area. He died in June 2008.Watson (Supernature), who labels himself "an old-fashioned naturalist," ranges through philosophy, psychology, anthropology, history, ecology and especially biology. He begins with the unlikely pair of Aristotle and Goldilocks, the former who urged humans to strive for "the golden mean" and the latter who was satisfied only when things were "just right." We living creatures are pawns of our genes, no matter what species we belong to, and the genes operate on three rules, according to Watson: be nasty to outsiders, be nice to insiders and cheat where possible. It is because of these rules that our bodies repel parasites, that Serbs kill Croats and that human babies often pretend to be younger or hungrier than they are. Watson believes that aggression is in our genes and examines such phenomena as war, rape and murder as manifestations of that aggression. But while he firmly believes that humans are made up of both good and evil and that natural selection is completely amoral, he is sanguine about humans as the world's first ethical animals with the capability of making moral decisions. $30,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Healing through Deliverance, vol. 1: The Foundation of Deliverance Ministry</h2><p>Jesus&#39; ministry included not only preaching and teaching, points out British Bible teacher Peter Horrobin, but fully one third of Christ&#39;s recorded healings involved deliverance. In a groundbreaking two-volume series, Horrobin urges believers to pay attention to this often-ignored dimension. Through in-depth Scripture teaching, he demonstrates persuasively that the charge Jesus gave his disciples to heal the sick and cast out demons was a vital part of the Great Commission for the whole church for all time. Healing through Deliverance, Volume 1 lays out the biblical basis for the ministry of healing and deliverance. Horrobin analyzes in detail the ministry of Jesus and the early church, as recording in the gospels and Acts, and answers many difficult questions. Healing through Deliverance, Volume 2 shows how people can be become affected by demonic powers and offers keys for bringing about healing through deliverance. Then Horrobin provides practical guidelines for building and conducting a healing and deliverance ministry through the local church and in ministry and counseling centers. With these two works, believers will be equipped to respond to all of God&#39;s call-to preach the gospel, heal the sick, and cast out demons.</p><p>Was Jesus&#39; charge to His disciples to cast out demons a vital part of the Great Commission?

In the run-up to World War II, as Winston Churchill called on a reluctant Britain to resist Adolf Hitler before it was too late, Jack Kennedy formed bonds of friendship and family that would forever change his life and the course of American history.<br><br>Drawing on many new primary sources, this book is the first to trace the dramatic arc of Kennedy's intellectual and political formation, and to detail the goals of his presidency as he saw them. For the first time we get an intimate picture of a leader torn between politics and principle, a president wrestling with private demons and unresolved conflicts dating back to the 1930s, when Churchill and Ambassador Joseph Kennedy were adversaries on the public stage. 24 pages of photographs.</p><p>Author of the critically acclaimed <i>Orson Welles</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Katharine Hepburn</i>, Barbara Leaming has also written for Vanity Fair and the New York Times Magazine. She lives in New Milford, Connecticut.Hollywood chronicler Leaming (<i>Orson Welles</i>;<i> Katharine Hepburn</i>) overreaches and overstates in her first attempt at political biography. Leaming endeavors to show how JFK's WWII-era relationships with British aristocrats (such as his doomed brother-in-law, Billy Hartington, heir to the duke of Devonshire), together with extensive readings in British political history and an idealization of Churchill, formed the mature Kennedy's brinkmanship approach to the Cold War. Leaming fails to point out that President Kennedy's modus operandi with regard to the Soviets followed precedent established by Truman and Eisenhower, and that JFK was often a junior partner in policies articulated by such NATO leaders as British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan&#x2014;all of them, of course, influenced to some extent by Churchill, who had first articulated the concept of an iron curtain. That Kennedy idealized and romanticized the British aristocracy is true. That this idealization had a great impact on his presidential philosophy regarding foreign policy is somewhat less so. In fact, America's longstanding cultural, emotional and ethical alliance with Britain, and the need to play hardball in the face of early 1960s Soviet aggression, would have gone a long way toward defining JFK's tactics in international relations even had he not visited England as a young man.<i> (May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Covert hypnosis, like "Ericksonian Hypnosis","operates through covert and subtle means... to reach deeper levels of consciousness than are touched by the surface structure of language".It is the concept that an individual, 'the hypnotist,' can control another individual's behavior via gaining rapport. During hypnosis, the operator or hypnotist makes suggestions. The subject is intended to not be completely aware, on a conscious level, of the manipulation.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Impostor</h2><p><i>The Impostor</i> is a searching account of the torment that besets Father C�nabre, historian of mysticism and controversial star of the Parisian clergy, when his faith suddenly deserts him. As the priest struggles to cope secretly, he crosses paths with associates on the complex margins of a Church facing modern politics in the early twentieth century. Georges Bernanos&#x2019;s compelling and dark portraits of that shadowy world&#x2019;s inhabitants throw into stark relief the determination of a humble priest, Father Chevance, who alone knows C�nabre&#x2019;s secret and struggles to save him. By turn touching and scathing, The Impostor explores the delicate balance between redemption and damnation and illuminates the fragility of our constructed selves.&nbsp;Georges Bernanos (1888&#x2013;1948), one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most powerful and idiosyncratic writers, was also the most original Roman Catholic writer of his time. <i>The Impostor</i>, the second of his novels published in French, is the last to be translated into English.</p><p>J.

The product of five years of research in consultation with the scholars at the C.G. Jung Institutes in New York and in Zurich, it carefully explains how each archetype interacts with the others and how the tarot can be viewed as a mirror of the human condition. Each trump card refers to one aspect of the dualities that Jung believed to be the key to the life process which he taught one has the capacity to resolve and thereby know the true meaning of life. And insofar as the cards represent key archetypes such as &#34;Mother,&#34; &#34;Father,&#34; &#34;Son&#34; and &#34;Daughter,&#34; the archetypes are considered cross-culturally and from the standpoints of many religions. For example, the High Priestess may be known as the Virgin Mary, as Isis, or as any pure and primary goddess.</p><p>Robert Wang's scholarly work has been heralded by many Jungians as an exceptional and clear introduction to the complexities of Jungian philosophy. It also serves as a major contribution to the history of tarot. <p>First published in 1988, The Jungian Tarot and Its Archetypal Imagery is intended to be a visual introduction to Jungian philosophy. The key is the archetypal image encountered through creative visualization or, as Jung called it, "active imagination." It is a process which may, theoretically, lead to discovery of a true Inner Self. Such creative visualization is at the heart of all mystical and religious systems, from those of the ancient world, to the spiritual exercises of Ignatius Loyola, to Hermeticism and Rosicrucianism, to Alchemy, and to the remarkably creative occult exercises of the nineteenth century. </p><p>Those familiar with Dr. Wang&#x2019;s earlier work, The Qabalistic Tarot, will be comfortable with his attribution of tarot cards to that central diagram, the Tree of Life. Wang considers this glyph to represent a hierarchy of archetypes and, indeed, a sort of road map of the collective unconscious. One of his main efforts in this exploration of Jungian philosophy is to demonstrate parallels between it and Hermetic Kabbalah, a system which has been essential to Western mysticism since the Italian Renaissance. </p><p>Wang explores Jung's ideas about regressions from the personal into the collective and considers them to be commensurate with the Kabbalistic method of working backwards from the lowest level of the Tree of Life (the material condition), through the upper levels which symbolize not only the enlightened Self, but a condition of non-being which transcends all consciousness, personal or collective. </p><p>This book also attempts to address a loose correlation of pantheons, under the file categories provided by tarot. It may be argued that ideas which emerge repeatedly across cultural boundaries lend credence to the postulate of archetypes which, in the minds of most people, is merely an interesting and remote theory. Wang is of the opinion that to rapidly skim across ancient concepts of, for example, a mother goddess, is to consider the various faces of the Mother archetype represented in tarot as The Empress. And, again, the main reason for making such a comparison is to determine if the "true" nature of an archetype is revealed by those areas where far-removed cultures have deities with similar qualities. In this regard, the earliest mythologies seem to be the most useful. </p><p>Just as Carl Jung brought the overview of a scientist to the age-old question of man's potential for self-knowledge, Wang has used his background as an art historian to explore how Jung wanted to understand the nature of consciousness, and&#x2014;ultimately&#x2014;to solve the problem which so engaged the Greeks, the relationship between the one and the many.</p>As an art historian, my amateur incursion into comparative religion is very tentative and my sources are general. I should also admit that as a historian I have a specific bias. History is, to me, something secure against which religious, mythological, and psychological ideologies must be measured, and it bothers me to find so many discussions of the history of tarot predicated upon irresponsible speculation (one of the unfortunate legacies of eighteenth-century romanticism), especially when the historical tracks of the cards are so clear. <p>Of course interpretation of the tarot in serious psychological terms would have seemed laughable, if not absolutely bizarre to its originators, who developed the cards as a game! It was not until the late nineteenth century that tarot was systematically related to Astrology, to Kabbalah, and to Alchemy. And it was the twentieth century which added an overlay of modern psychological theory. </p><p>Finally, let me say that this work, which is predicated on Jung's rather remarkable methodology, is in no way intended to present a belief system. Nothing except the historical facts should be taken at face value. The exercise of dealing with each of the tarot keys as an archetypal image is meant to stimulate thought about the nature of consciousness and about the root causes of the human condition.</p></p><h2>Gustav Stickley&#39;s Craftsman Homes and Bungalows</h2><p>In 1901, Gustav Stickley began to create the first uniquely American style of furniture and home design&#x2014;known as Craftsman. Stickley's principles of home design include construction that is in harmony with its landscape, open floor plans, built-in storage, and natural lighting. He was a major influence on Frank Lloyd Wright, and he remains one of the great names in American architecture. <i>Craftsman Homes and Bungalows</i> showcases his work in an affordable, attractive new edition. Featuring hundreds of black-and-white photographs, line drawings, and sketches of cabins, cottages, and bungalows from concept to finished product, it presents easy-to-understand directions on both home construction and improvement. This resource, a combination of three of Stickley's works, is a comprehensive introduction to the design and building of beautiful Craftsman homes.</p><p><strong>Gustav Stickley</strong> (1858-1942) was a leader and innovator in America's Arts and Crafts movement and published several books, magazines, and articles on the subject.</p><h2>The Portable Pediatrician for Parents</h2><p>Aimed at today&#39;s time-pressed parents, a practical, step-by-step guide to the first five years of life gives advice on both medical and behavioral matters and includes complete disease information, health-care tips, and more.</p><p>Some parents in the post-Spock generation may think that when it comes to basic childcare instruction, Heidi Murkoff's What to Expect series is the only game in town. But there are alternatives, and this one has a considerable advantage--especially from the viewpoint of parents with more than one small child--in that it covers birth-to-5 in a single, manageable volume. Laura Walther Nathanson, M.D., FAAP, also serves up loads of useful information--everything from breastfeeding to the impact of divorce on a child--in a writing style that's authoritative without being pompous. She sounds less like a medical expert who happens to deal with children, and more like a fellow-parent who happens to be a medical expert. She refers to 3 and 4 year olds simply as Threes and Fours, pee is pee, and poo is poo. There are a couple of drawbacks, however. A minor complaint is the shockingly poor quality of the line illustrations, which manage to make smiling toddlers look deranged at best and demonic at worst. A more major issue is the book's bland layout--there is lots and lots of plain gray text and very little has been done to make the most important information leap to the eye. Nonetheless, this is such an excellent source of information that it is a must for every parent's shelf. <i>--Richard Farr</i><p>Dr. Laura Nathanson is the author of <em>The Portable Pediatrician</em>, as well as several other books.

In that time she has evolved from an iconoclastic outsider to an internationally revered figure, with two British Designer of the Year awards, an OBE, her own successful fashion label and an unrivalled reputation for leading where other designers follow.* Her lifestyle could scarcely be in greater contrast to the opulence which surrounds other leading designers: until recently she lived in a modest council flat in South London, and she still travels around the capital by bicycle, dressed in her own flamboyant creations, with a plastic bag protecting her hair from the elements. How did an awkward girl from a conventional and provincial background become one of world fashion's most influential and respected designers? How has she managed to remain true to her own idiosyncratic vision, refusing to conform to the fashion industry's, and society's, expectations?* Speaking to Westwood herself, her friends, lovers, colleagues, rivals, admirers and detractors, Jane Mulvagh has created a portrait as rich, distinctive and constantly surprising as her subject's character and work.</p><p>Jane Mulvagh is a fashion historian, journalist, columnist on the Financial Times, author of The Vogue History of 20th Century Fashion (Viking) and Costume Jewellery in Vogue (Thames and Hudson).

A snobbish, inept and generally insufferable youngster when he joined the frontline regiment, Vaughan was eventually humbled both by the tongue-lashings of superiors and by his ego-shattering experiences in the trenches. He is frank about his fear of death, which renders the material in the latter half of the diary all the more moving, for one discerns that Vaughan is gradually turning into a brave and capable leader of infantry.

In this entirely original work, Stephen Turnbull, a leading authority on Japanese history and author of more than 50 books, reveals the soul of the samurai in a thoughtful exploration of the religions and philosophies that motivated them. Drawing inspiration from all manners of belief systems &#x2013; from Japan&#x2019;s mainstream religions of Shinto and Buddhism, to Confucianism, Christianity, and Folk Religion &#x2013; the samurai were fascinating men who often valued their honor above their lives.<br>THE SAMURAI AND THE SACRED is strikingly illustrated with lavish Japanese prints and vibrant photographs. A provocative study, it includes chapters on martial arts, modern militarism, the cult of the sword, revenge, suicide, <i>hara kiri</i> and <i>kamikaze </i>pilots. THE SAMURAI AND THE SACRED is a compelling read that provides insight into Japanese culture, philosophy, and warfare.</p><p>Stephen Turnbull took his first degree at Cambridge University, and received a PhD from Leeds University for his work on Japanese religious history. He has travelled extensively in Europe and the Far East and also runs a well-used picture library. His work has been recognised by the awarding of the Canon Prize of the British Association for Japanese Studies and a Japan Festival Literary Award. He divides his time between lecturing in Japanese Religion at the University of Leeds and writing. The author lives in Leeds, UK.<b>Praise for Stephen Turnbull's <i>Samurai - World of the Warrior</i> from Professor Richard Holmes:</b> <br><br>"A lively and compelling study of the samurai, the warrior elite of old Japan. Stephen Turnbull blends real scholarship with a flair for story telling to create a gripping account. It is good to see illustrations that rise to the high quality of the text to produce a book wholly worthy of the remarkable characters it describes."<br><br><b>On the paperback edition:</b> <br><br>"Both spirituality and military history collections - as well as those strong in Japanese history in particular - will welcome <i>The Samurai and the Sacred</i>, a fine study examining the spiritual world of the samurai from their involvement in Japanese mainstream religions to their feature in Christianity and folk religions.

Now, nearly fifteen years later, <em>Titanic</em> has remained one of the most critically acclaimed and highest-grossing motion picture epics of all time, becoming a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>In this updated edition of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, discover everything you&#x2019;ve always wanted to know about <em>Titanic</em>, from the actual construction of the &#x201c;ship of dreams&#x201d; to the casting of Jack and Rose, one of the most memorable film couples in Hollywood history.

Celebrated for such uncompromising action-adventure films as <em>The Terminator</em>, <em>Aliens</em>, <em>True Lies</em>, and <em>Avatar</em>, the writer-director actually vowed not to make <em>Titanic</em> unless he could successfully dive to the wreck himself and bring back motion picture footage for use in the film. Representing years of Cameron&#x2019;s passion and dedication, <em>Titanic</em> is one of the filmmaker&#x2019;s most ambitious films. </p><p>Ed W.

He came to the throne through the brutal murder of his cousin, Elagabalus, and was ultimately assassinated himself. The years between were filled with regular uprisings and rebellions, court intrigue (the Praetorian Guard slew their commander at the Emperor's feet) and foreign invasion. Yet the ancient sources generally present his reign as a golden age of just government, prosperity and religious tolerance <br><br>Not yet fourteen when he became emperor, Alexander was dominated by his mother, Julia Mammaea and advisors like the historian, Cassius Dio. In the military field, he successfully checked the aggressive Sassanid Persians but some sources see his Persian campaign as a costly failure marked by mutiny and reverses that weakened the army. When Germanic and Sarmatian tribes crossed the Rhine and Danube frontiers in 234, Alexander took the field against them but when he attempted to negotiate to buy time, his soldiers perceived him as weak, assassinated him and replaced him with the soldier Maximinus Thrax. John McHugh reassesses this fascinating emperor in detail.</p><p>John S McHugh has a BA and MA in Ancient History. His love of the ancient world has led him to travel to many classical sites. He is currently an Assistant Headmaster at a secondary school in Bolton. He is the co-author of a text book on Boltons connections with the slave trade and is currently assisting Bolton Museum with a project to record the oral history of the local populace with the aim of promoting understanding between people of different generations or ethnic and social backgrounds.&#x201c;British academic McHugh, who has written on the Emperor Commodus and other subjects, does a masterful job in giving us this life of Alexander Severus set within his unstable times which presaged even more instability...

Through their honest, gut-level responses to their real-life circumstances, the psalmists show joy, anger, bitterness, guilt, resentment, vindictiveness, and most of the other emotions all of us feel at some time in our lives. In looking carefully at Psalms 6, 12, 13, 22, 32, 39, 42, 56, 69, and 73, the author explains how they reveal the truth about our own grief, despair, defeat, guilt, fear, desperation, hate, stress, unfairness, and sin. &#x201c;The Lord is near to the brokenhearted,&#x201d; assures the psalmist. In a pain-filled world, only He can heal our broken hearts.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;What becomes of the brokenhearted?&#x201d;</p> <p>Do you remember this now-classic music hit? Well, this question certainly long predates that 1960s hit, and is still around today as the heart-cry of every person who has been affected by the brutal experiences of life.</p> <p>The writers of Scripture wrestled with these same experiences and resulting emotions, and nowhere are the personal depths of grief and the cries of the broken heart more clearly revealed than in the Psalms. In fact, no book of the Bible is more transparent than the Psalms, where the songwriters deal honestly with all of the events of life, including its darkest moments. Through their honest, gut-level responses to their real-life circumstances, the psalmists show what it means to live through the emotions all of us feel at some time in our lives.</p> <p>In <i>Singing the Songs of the Brokenhearted</i>, Bible teacher and author Bill Crowder offers an insightful exploration of ten of these psalms, including:</p> <p>Psalm 6: The Heart Broken by Grief&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 12: The Heart Broken by Despair</p> <p>Psalm 13: The Heart Broken by Defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 32: The Heart Broken by Guilt</p> <p>Psalm 39: The Heart Broken by Fear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 42: The Heart Broken by Desperation</p> <p>Psalm 56: The Heart Broken by Hate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 69: The Heart Broken by Stress</p> <p>Psalm 73: The Heart Broken by Unfairness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 22: The Heart Broken by Sin</p> <p>&#x201c;The Lord is near to the brokenhearted,&#x201d; assures the psalmist.

There were so many facets that&nbsp;drew me to Ransom&#x2019;s book. The photographs spoke to me on an&nbsp;emotional level; there was a sense of mystery, power, and creepiness.&nbsp;I liked that they provoked my imagination, and that I didn&#x2019;t immediately,&nbsp;know everything about the images. The narrative was reminiscent&nbsp;of a fairy tale or a fable. It mixed up the past and present,and centered on kids who have strange abilities, afflictions even, that they manage to live with and incorporate into their lives. They aren&#x2019;t&nbsp;superhuman, but they are unusual. And like any good fantasy, the&nbsp;story was rooted in reality and drew on real feelings. Every step the&nbsp;novel took was unexpected and didn&#x2019;t follow a traditional path. I&nbsp;liked that the book is not so easily categorized. It has been classified&nbsp;as young adult, dark fantasy, but as is often the case with categorizations,&nbsp;this seems unnecessarily limiting. I think it&#x2019;s for all ages,&nbsp;and I never understood the classification of what is considered dark.&nbsp;I often find what is considered normal&#x2014;such as going to school or&nbsp;having my aunt visit&#x2014;as some of the most terrifying ordeals I have&nbsp;endured. On the other hand, I find watching a monster movie comforting.&nbsp;I think those kinds of films are an outlet, that they give&nbsp;people a way to cope with psychological sentiments in their lives they&nbsp;are trying to understand. I found Ransom&#x2019;s novel compelling in a&nbsp;similar way to old horror movies, and I was drawn to the material&nbsp;enough to make a movie about it because I wanted to further explore&nbsp;Miss Peregrine&#x2019;s world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#x2019;m always asked why I&#x2019;m so attracted to the outsider, and I think&nbsp;it&#x2019;s because many people have felt that way at one point in their lives.&nbsp;Once they have, no matter how popular people become, or successful,&nbsp;those feelings of not fitting in are still there&#x2014;it&#x2019;s written into their&nbsp;DNA. I can certainly relate. Jane Goldman, who really understands&nbsp;peculiar people, has done a fantastic job of translating the vibe of&nbsp;the novel into a script. Basing a film on a book is sometimes one of&nbsp;the hardest transitions, because they are such different scenarios. But&nbsp;the most important aspect, which I feel she&#x2019;s done, is to capture the&nbsp;vibe that attracted us both to the book in the first place. It&#x2019;s a balance&nbsp;of many different elements&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a little scary, a little funny, a little&nbsp;mysterious. Like the book, there&#x2019;s also a simplicity to it. It&#x2019;s very&nbsp;human based, which I think is important to retain, so that people can<br> identify with the emotions of the characters.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This film was shot in several locations, with many challenges. I&nbsp;wanted it to be a more practical approach, trying to do the effects live&nbsp;when possible&#x2014;though calling it practical is a bit questionable since&nbsp;it wasn&#x2019;t so practical for the cast, who were put through the ringer on&nbsp;a daily basis. I was lucky that they supported this approach, despite&nbsp;the difficulties of trying to do as much as possible on-camera, in real&nbsp;locations and sets. We navigated uncooperative weather, different&nbsp;climates, three countries, a real boat, a fake boat, and an underwater&nbsp;tank. We created rain showers, snow showers, snowballs, pelted people&nbsp;with candy, set Sam Jackson on fire, reversed time, made people eat&nbsp;eyeballs, flew the cast around on wires, had them sliding off roofs,&nbsp;buffeted them with super-powered fans, covered them in bee stings,&nbsp;turned people to stone, created about fifty versions of the same house,&nbsp;battled ticks and time, and generally had a blast. It was everything I&nbsp;love about filmmaking: the surreal situations and opportunities it&nbsp;offers the cast and crew, the strange places you find yourself in, and&nbsp;the unexpected and creative moments that happen every day. Filming&nbsp;is often a series of unexpected outcomes. That&#x2019;s the joy and beauty&nbsp;of it&#x2014;that it is constantly new and unpredictable. Most importantly,&nbsp;filmmaking is about the people you meet and work and bond with.&nbsp;I feel so fortunate that my job allows me to work with such a group&nbsp;of amazing and creative people that can take an idea to the next level.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So much hard work has gone into this movie and this book is a&nbsp;celebration of that. It offers the reader a taste of the filmmaking&nbsp;experience. Any movie requires an intense collaborative effort to&nbsp;achieve what appears on screen, and so much of that extends beyond&nbsp;the period of actual filming. This film has been five years in the&nbsp;making. A lot of imagination and skill went into creating Miss Peregrine&#x2019;s&nbsp;world. I&#x2019;d like to thank everyone for their dedication, attention&nbsp;to detail, and for caring so much. I&#x2019;d also like to thank anyone&nbsp;who sees <i>Miss Peregrine&#x2019;s Home for Peculiar Children</i> and enjoys it. Your&nbsp;enthusiasm is one of the reasons I keep making films.<br><br><i>Tim Burton</i></p><h2>Prolog programming for artificial intelligence (International computer science series)</h2><p>Prolog, the logic programming language, is now recognized as a powerful vehicle for non-numeric programming.

And Leslie, as the novel opens, idealizes the other three, as she tries to convince her mother to let her use her small nest egg to attend art school in London.</p><p>As the four friends balance their youthful ideals with the realities of work and romance in 1930s England, Orange offers hilarious and thoughtful perspectives on the quandaries of educated, ambitious women in a world not yet ready for them.

But when she was four the family returned to England. She was later &#x2018;finished&#x2019; in Paris, and then went up to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1928. It was there that she and Tim Tindall met. They won a substantial sum of money on a horse, enough to provide the couple with the financial independence to marry, which they did in 1934.</p><p>Ursula Orange&#x2019;s first novel, <i>Begin Again</i>, was published with success in 1936, followed by <i>To Sea in a Sieve</i> in 1937. In 1938 her daughter, the writer Gillian Tindall, was born, and the next year the war changed their lives completely. Their London home was badly damaged and, as her husband left for the army, Ursula settled in the country with Gillian, where she had ample opportunity to observe the comic, occasionally tragic, effects of evacuation: the subject of her biggest success, <i>Tom Tiddler&#x2019;s Ground</i> (1941). Three more novels followed, continuing to deal with the indirect effects of war: conflicts of attitude, class and the generations, wherever disparate characters are thrown together.</p><p>The end of the war saw the family reunited and in 1947 the birth of her son Nicholas. But Ursula Orange&#x2019;s literary career foundered, and the years that followed saw her succumb to severe depression and periods of hospital treatment. In 1955 she died aged 46.</p></p><h2>The Little Stranger</h2><p>From the multi-award-winning and bestselling author of <b>The Night Watch</b> and <b>Fingersmith</b> comes an astonishing novel about love, loss, and the sometimes unbearable weight of the past.<br><br>In a dusty post-war summer in rural Warwickshire, a doctor is called to see a patient at lonely Hundreds Hall.

All around, the world is changing, and the family is struggling to adjust to a society with new values and rules.<br><br>Roddie Ayres, who returned from World War II physically and emotionally wounded, is desperate to keep the house and what remains of the estate together for the sake of his mother and his sister, Caroline. Mrs. Ayres is doing her best to hold on to the gracious habits of a gentler era and Caroline seems cheerfully prepared to continue doing the work a team of servants once handled, even if it means having little chance for a life of her own beyond Hundreds.<br><br>But as Dr. Faraday becomes increasingly entwined in the Ayreses�&#x20ac;&#x2122; lives, signs of a more disturbing nature start to emerge, both within the family and in Hundreds Hall itself. And Faraday begins to wonder if they are all threatened by something more sinister than a dying way of life, something that could subsume them completely.<br><br>Both a nuanced evocation of 1940s England and the most chill-inducing novel of psychological suspense in years, <b>The Little Stranger</b> confirms Sarah Waters as one of the finest and most exciting novelists writing today.</p><p>Sarah Waters is the bestselling author of four previous novels: <b>Tipping the Velvet</b>; <b>Affinity</b>; <b>Fingersmith</b>; and <b>The Night Watch</b>. Winner of many literary awards, she has been shortlisted for both the Man Booker and Orange Prizes. She lives in London.<b>Chapter 1, Part 1</b><br>I first saw Hundreds Hall when I was ten years old. It was the summer after the war, and the Ayreses still had most of their money then, were still big people in the district. The event was an Empire Day f�te: I stood with a line of other village children making a Boy Scout salute while Mrs Ayres and the Colonel went past us, handing out commemorative medals; afterwards we sat to tea with our parents at long tables on what I suppose was the south lawn. Mrs Ayres would have been twenty-four or -five, her husband a few years older; their little girl, Susan, would have been about six. They must have made a very handsome family, but my memory of them is vague. I recall most vividly the house itself, which struck me as an absolute mansion. I remember its lovely ageing details: the worn red brick, the cockled window glass, the weathered sandstone edgings. They made it look blurred and slightly uncertain&#x2013;like an ice, I thought, just beginning to melt in the sun.<br><br>There were no trips inside, of course. The doors and French windows stood open, but each had a rope or a ribbon tied across it; the lavatories set aside for our use were the grooms&#x2019; and the gardeners&#x2019;, in the stable block. My mother, however, still had friends among the servants, and when the tea was finished and people were given the run of the grounds, she took me quietly into the house by a side door, and we spent a little time with the cook and the kitchen girls. The visit impressed me terribly. The kitchen was a basement one, reached by a cool vaulted corridor with something of the feel of a castle dungeon. An extraordinary number of people seemed to be coming and going along it with hampers and trays. The girls had such a mountain of crockery to wash, my mother rolled up her sleeves to help them; and&nbsp;to my very great delight, as a reward for her labour I was allowed to take my pick of the jellies and &#x2018;shapes&#x2019; that had come back uneaten from the f�te. I was put to sit at a deal-topped table, and given a spoon from the family&#x2019;s own drawer&#x2013;a heavy thing of dulled silver, its bowl almost bigger than my mouth.<br><br>But then came an even greater treat. High up on the wall of the vaulted passage was a junction-box of wires and bells, and when one of these bells was set ringing, calling the parlourmaid upstairs, she took me with her, so that I might peep past the green baize curtain that separated the front of the house from the back. I could stand and wait for her there, she said, if I was very good and quiet. I must only be sure to keep behind the curtain, for if the Colonel or the missus were to see me, there&#x2019;d be a row.<br><br>I was an obedient child, as a rule. But the curtain opened onto the corner junction of two marble-floored passages, each one filled with marvellous things; and once she had disappeared softly in one direction, I took a few daring steps in the other. The thrill of it was astonishing. I don&#x2019;t mean the simple thrill of trespass, I mean the thrill of the house itself, which came to me from every surface&#x2013;from the polish on the floor, the patina on wooden chairs and cabinets, the bevel of a looking-glass, the scroll of a frame. I was drawn to one of the dustless white walls, which had a decorative plaster border, a representation of acorns and leaves. I had never seen anything like it, outside of a church, and after a second of looking it over I did what strikes me now as a dreadful thing: I worked my fingers around one of the acorns and tried to prise it from its setting; and when that failed to release it, I got out my penknife and dug away with that. I didn&#x2019;t do it in a spirit of vandalism. I wasn&#x2019;t a spiteful or destructive boy. It was simply that, in admiring the house, I wanted to possess a piece of it&#x2013;or rather, as if the admiration itself, which I suspected a more ordinary child would not have felt, entitled me to it. I was like a man, I suppose, wanting a lock of hair from the head of a girl he had suddenly and blindingly become enamoured of. <br><br>I&#x2019;m afraid the acorn gave at last, though less cleanly than I&#x2019;d been expecting, with a tug of fibre and a fall of white powder and grit; I remember that as disappointing. Possibly I&#x2019;d imagined it to be made of marble. <br><br>But nobody came, nobody caught me. It was, as they say, the work of a moment. I put the acorn in my pocket, and slipped back behind the curtain. The parlourmaid returned a minute later and took me back downstairs; my mother and I said goodbye to the kitchen staff, and rejoined my father in the garden. I felt the hard plaster lump in my pocket, now, with a sort of sick excitement. I&#x2019;d begun to be anxious that Colonel Ayres, a frightening man, would discover the damage and stop the f�te. But the afternoon ran on without incident until the bluish drawing-in of dusk. My parents and I joined other Lidcote people for the long walk home, the bats flitting and wheeling with us along the lanes as if whirled on invisible strings.<br><br>My mother found the acorn, of course, eventually. I had been drawing it in and out of my pocket, and it had left a chalky trail on the grey flannel of my shorts. When she understood what the queer little thing in her hand was, she almost wept. She didn&#x2019;t smack me, or tell my father; she never had the heart for arguments. Instead she looked at me, with her tearful eyes, as if baffled and ashamed.<br><br>&#x2018;You ought to know better, a clever lad like you,&#x2019; I expect she said.<br><br>People were always saying things like that to me when I was young. My parents, my uncles, my schoolmasters&#x2013;all the various adults who interested themselves in my career. The words used to drive me into secret rages, because on the one hand I wanted desperately to live up to my own reputation for cleverness; and on the other it seemed very unfair, that that cleverness, which I had never asked for, could be turned into something with which to cut me down.<br><br>The acorn was put on the fire. I found the blackened nub of it among the clinker, next day. That must have been the last grand year for Hundreds Hall, anyway. The following Empire Day f�te was given by another family, in one of the neighbouring big houses; Hundreds had started its steady decline. Soon afterwards the Ayreses&#x2019; daughter died, and Mrs Ayres and the Colonel began to live less publicly. I dimly remember the births of their next two children, Caroline and Roderick&#x2013;but by then I was at Leamington College, and busy with bitter little battles of my own. My mother died when I was fifteen. She had had miscarriage after miscarriage, it turned out, all through my childhood, and the last one killed her. My father lived just long enough to see me graduate from medical school and return to Lidcote a qualified man. Colonel Ayres died a few years later&#x2013;an aneurism, I think. <br><br>With his death, Hundreds Hall withdrew even further from the world. The gates of the park were kept almost permanently closed. The solid brown stone boundary wall, though not especially&nbsp; high, was high enough to seem forbidding. And for all that the house was such a grand one, there was no spot, on any of the lanes in that part of Warwickshire, from which it could be glimpsed. I sometimes thought of it, tucked away in there, as I passed the wall on my rounds&#x2013;picturing it always as it had seemed to me that day in 1919, with its handsome brick faces, and its cool marble passages, each one filled with marvellous things.<br><br>So when I did see the house again&#x2013;almost thirty years on from that first visit, and shortly after the end of another war&#x2013;the changes in it appalled me. It was the purest chance that took me out there, for&nbsp; the Ayreses were registered with my partner, David Graham; but he was busy with an emergency case that day, so when the family sent out for a doctor the request was passed on to me. My heart began to sink almost the moment I let myself into the park. I remembered a long approach to the house through neat rhododendron and laurel, but the park was now so overgrown and untended, my small car had to fight its way down the drive. When I broke free of the bushes at last and found myself on a sweep of lumpy gravel with the Hall directly ahead of me, I put on the brake, and gaped in dismay. The house was smaller than in memory, of course&#x2013;not quite the mansion I&#x2019;d been recalling&#x2013; but I&#x2019;d been expecting that. What horrified me were the signs of decay. Sections of the lovely weathered edgings seemed to have fallen completely away, so that the house&#x2019;s uncertain Georgian outline was even more tentative than before. Ivy had spread, then patchily died, and hung like tangled rat&#x2019;s-tail hair. The steps leading up to the broad front door were cracked, with weeds growing lushly up through the seams.<br><br>I parked my car, climbed out, and almost feared to slam the door. The place, for so large and solid a structure, felt precarious. No one appeared to have heard me arrive, so after a little hesitation I went crunching over the gravel and gingerly climbed the cracked stone steps. It was a hot, still summer&#x2019;s day&#x2013;so windless that when I tugged on the tarnished old brass and ivory bell-pull I caught the ring of it, pure and clear, but distant, as if in the belly of the house. The ring was immediately followed by the faint, gruff barking of a dog.&nbsp;<br><br>The barks were very soon cut off, and for another long minute there was silence. Then, from somewhere to my right, I heard the scrape of an irregular footstep, and a moment later the son of the family, Roderick, appeared around the corner of the house. He squinted over at me with some suspicion, until noticing the bag in my hand. Drawing a collapsed-looking cigarette from his mouth he called, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re the doctor, are you? We were expecting Dr Graham.&#x2019;<br><br>His tone was friendly enough, but had a touch of languor to it; as if he were bored by the sight of me already. I left the steps and went over to him, introdu...</p><h2>National Geographic Dawn to Dark Photographs: The Magic of Light</h2><p>The world's best landscape photography and photojournalism stunningly depicts the passage of a single day, from dawn's first light to the closing moments of sunset.

Deep in the wilderness, Peggy and James make a life for themselves. They repair the hut, bathe in water from the river, hunt and gather food in the summers and almost starve in the harsh winters. They mark their days only by the sun and the seasons. When Peggy finds a pair of boots in the forest and begins a search for their owner, she unwittingly begins to unravel the series of events that brought her to the woods and, in doing so, discovers the strength she needs to go back to the home and mother she thought she&#x2019;d lost.

Fuller eschews the conventional means of providing labored explanations of emotions, and in its place deftly relies on the power of description to invoke genuine feeling. <b>The result is beautiful.

The scarred, sinewy fighter tapped the skull with one edge of his knife, causing the fleshless watcher to wobble. Behind the macabre sight, they could just make out the spike that had pierced their predecessor's head, leaving him dangling until time had let all but the skull drop to the floor in a confused heap.<br><br>"Did you think we would be?" whispered the tall, cowled figure. If Sadun had a lean, almost acrobatic look to his build, Fauztin seemed nearly cadaverous. The Vizjerei sorcerer moved almost like a phantom as he, too, touched the skull, this time with one gloved finger. "No sorcery here, though. Only crude but sufficient mechanics. Nothing to fear."<br><br>"Unless it's your head on the next pole."<br><br>The Vizjerei tugged at his thin, gray goatee. His slightly slanted eyes closed once as if in acknowledgment to his partner's last statement. Whereas Sadun had a countenance more akin to an untrustworthy weasel -- and sometimes the personality to match -- Fauztin reminded some of a withered cat. His nub of a nose, constantly twitching, and the whiskers hanging underneath that nose only added to the illusion.<br><br>Neither had ever had a reputation for purity, but Norrec Vizharan would have trusted either with his life -- and had several times over. As he joined them, the veteran warrior peered ahead, to where a vast darkness hinted of some major chamber. Thus far, they had explored seven different levels in all and found them curiously devoid of all but the most primitive traps.<br><br>They had also found them devoid of any treasure whatsoever, a tremendous disappointment to the tiny party.<br><br>"Are you sure there's no sorcery about here, Fauztin? None at all?"<br><br>The feline features half-hidden by the cowl wrinkled further in mild offense. The wide shoulders of his voluminous cloak gave Fauztin a foreboding, almost supernatural appearance, especially since he towered over the brawnier Norrec, no small man himself. "You have to ask that, my friend?"<br><br>"It's just that it makes no sense! Other than a few minor and pretty pathetic traps, we've encountered nothing to prevent us from reaching the main chamber! Why go through all the trouble of digging this out, then leave it so sparsely defended!"<br><br>"I don't call a spider as big as my head <i>nothing,"</i> Sadun interjected sourly, absently scratching his lengthy but thinning black hair. "Especially as it was <i>on</i> my head at the time..."<br><br>Norrec ignored him. "Is it what I think? Are we too late? Is this Tristram all over again?"<br><br>Once before, between serving causes as mercenaries, they had hunted for treasure in a small, troubled village called Tristram. Legend had had it that, in a lair guarded by fiends, there could be found a treasure so very extraordinary in value, it would make kings of those fortunate enough to live to find it. Norrec and his friends had journeyed there, entering the labyrinth in the dead of night without the knowledge of the local populace... <br><br>And after all their efforts, after battling strange beasts and narrowly avoiding deadly traps...they had found that someone else had stripped the underground maze of nearly anything of value. Only upon returning to the village had they learned the sorry truth, that a great champion had descended into the labyrinth but a few weeks before and supposedly slain the terrible demon, Diablo. He had taken no gold or jewels, but other adventurers who had arrived shortly thereafter had made good use of his handiwork, dealing with the lesser dangers and carrying off all they could find. But a few days' difference had left the trio with nothing to show for their efforts... <br><br>Norrec himself had also taken no consolation in the words of one villager of dubious sanity who had, as they had prepared to depart, warned that the champion, so-called the Wanderer, had not defeated Diablo but, rather, had accidently freed the foul evil. A questioning glance by Norrec toward Fauztin had been answered at first with an indifferent shrug by the Vizjerei sorcerer.<br><br>"There are always stories of escaping demons and terrible curses," Fauztin had added at the time, complete dismissal of the wild warning in his tone. "Diablo is generally in most of the favorites whispered among common folk."<br><br>"You don't think there's anything to it?" As a child, Norrec had grown up being scared by his elders with tales of Diablo, Baal, and other monsters of the night, all stories designed to make him be good.<br><br>Sadun Tryst had snorted. "You ever seen a demon yourself? Know anyone that had?"<br><br>Norrec had not. "Have you, Fauztin? They say Vizjerei can summon demons to do their bidding."<br><br>"If I could do that, do you think I would be scrounging in empty labyrinths and tombs?"<br><br>And that comment, more than anything else, had convinced Norrec then to chalk the villager's words down as yet another tall tale. In truth, it had not been hard to do. After all, the only thing that had mattered then to the three had been what mattered now -- wealth.<br><br>Unfortunately, it seemed more and more likely that once again those riches had eluded them.<br><br>As he peered down the passage, Fauztin's other gloved hand tightened around the spell staff he wielded. The jeweled top -- the source of their light -- flared briefly. "I had hoped I was wrong, but now I fear it is so. We are far from the first to delve this deep into this place."<br><br>The slightly graying fighter swore under his breath. He had served under many a commander in his life, most of them during the crusades from Westmarch, and from surviving those various campaigns -- often by the skin of his teeth -- he had come to one conclusion. No one could hope to rise in the world without money. He had made it as far as captain, been broken in rank thrice, then finally retired in disgust after the last debacle.<br><br>War had been Norrec's life since he had been old enough to raise a sword. Once, he had also had something of a family, but they were now as dead as his ideals. He still considered himself a decent man, but decency did not fill one's stomach. There had to be another way, Norrec had decided... <br><br>And so, with his two comrades, he had gone in search of treasure.<br><br>Like Sadun, he had his share of scars, but Norrec's visage otherwise resembled more that of a simple farmer. Wide brown eyes, with a broad, open face and a strong jaw, he would have looked at home behind a hoe. Yet, while that vision occasionally appealed to the sturdy veteran, he knew that he needed the gold to pay for that land. This quest should have led them to riches far beyond his needs, far beyond his dreams... <br><br>Now, it seemed as if it had all been a waste of time and effort...again.<br><br>Beside him, Sadun Tryst tossed his knife into the air, then expertly caught it at the hilt as it fell. He did this twice more, clearly thinking. Norrec could just imagine what he thought about. They had spent months on this particular quest, journeying across the sea to northern Kehjistan, sleeping in the cold and rain, following false trails and empty caves, eating whatever vermin they could find when other hunting proved scarce -- and all because of Norrec, the one who had instigated this entire fiasco.<br><br>Worse, <i>this</i> quest had actually come about because of a dream, a dream concerning a wicked mountain peak bearing some crude resemblance to a dragon's head. Had he dreamt of it only once, perhaps twice, Norrec might have forgotten the image, but over the years, it had repeated itself far too many times. Wherever he had fought, Norrec had watched for the peak, but to no avail. Then, a comrade -- later dead -- from these chill northern lands had made mention of such a place in passing. Ghosts were said to haunt it and men who traveled near the mountain often disappeared or were discovered years later, all flesh stripped from the shattered bones... <br><br>There and then, Norrec Vizharan had been certain that destiny had tried to call him here.<br><br>But if so -- why to a tomb already vandalized?<br><br>The entrance had been well hidden in the rock face, but definitely open to the outside. That should have been his first clue to the truth, yet Norrec had refused to even see the discrepancy. All his hopes, all his promises to his companions... <br><br>"Damn!" He kicked at the nearest wall, only his sturdy boot saving him from a few broken toes. Norrec threw his sword to the ground, continuing to curse his naivete.<br><br>"There's some new general from Westmarch hiring on mercenaries," Sadun helpfully suggested. "They say he's got big ambitions..."<br><br>"No more war," muttered Norrec, trying not to show the pain coursing through his foot. "No more trying to die for other people's glory."<br><br>"I just thought -- "<br><br>The lanky sorcerer tapped the ground once with his staff, seeking the attention of both his earthier partners. "At this point, it would be foolish not to go on to the central chamber. Perhaps those who were here before us left a few baubles or coins. We did find a few gold coins in Tristram. Certainly it would not hurt to search a little longer, would it, Norrec?"<br><br>He knew that the Vizjerei only sought to assuage his friend's bitter emotions, but still the idea managed to take root in the veteran's mind. All he needed were a few gold coins! He was still young enough to take a bride, begin a new life, maybe even raise a family... <br><br>Norrec picked up his sword, hefting the weapon that had served him so well over the years. He had kept it cleaned and honed, taking pride in one of the few items truly his own. A look of determination spread across his visage. "Let's go."<br><br>"You've a way with words for one using so few," Sadun jested to the sorcerer as they started off.<br><br>"And you use so many words for one with so few things worth saying."<br><br>The friendly argument between his companions helped settle Norrec's troubled mind. It reminded him of other times, when, between the three of them, they had persevered through worse difficulties.<br><br>Yet, the talk died as they approached what surely had to be the last and most significant chamber. Fauztin called a halt, staring briefly at the jewel atop the staff.<br><br>"Before we proceed inside, the two of you had better light torches."<br><br>pard<br><br>They had saved the torches for emergencies, the sorcerer's staff serving well until now. Fauztin said no more, but as Norrec used tinder to light his, he wondered if the Vizjerei had finally noted sorcery of some significance. If so, then perhaps there still remained some sort of treasure... <br><br>With his own torch lit, Norrec used it to set Sadun's ablaze. Now surrounded with more secure illumination, the trio set off again.<br><br>"I swear," grumbled the wiry Sadun, a few moments later. "I swear that the hair on the back of my head's standing on end!"<br><br>Norrec felt the same. Neither fighter argued when the Vizjerei took the lead. The clans of the Far East had long studied the magical arts and Fauztin's people had studied them longer than most. If a situation arose where sorcery had to take a hand, certainly it made sense to leave it to the thin spellcaster. Norrec and Sadun would be there to guard him from other assaults.<br><br>The arrangement had worked so far.<br><br>Unlike the heavy boots of the warriors, the sandaled feet of Fauztin made no sound as he walked. The mage stretched forth his staff and Norrec noticed that, despite its power, the jewel failed to illuminate much. Only the torches seemed to act as they should.<br><br>"This is old and powerful. Our predecessors may not have been so fortunate as we first believed. We may find some treasure yet."<br><br>And possibly more. Norrec's grip on the sword tightened to the point that his knuckles whitened. He wanted gold, but he also wanted to live to spend it.<br><br>With the staff proving unreliable, the two fighters took to the front. That did not mean that Fauztin would no longer be of any aid to the band. Even now, the veteran knew, his magical companion thought out the quickest, surest spells for whatever they might encounter.<br><br>"It looks as dark as the grave in there," Sadun mumbled.<br><br>Norrec said nothing. Now a few steps ahead of both his comrades, he became the first to actually reach the chamber itself. Despite the dangers that might lurk within, he almost felt drawn to it, as if something inside called to him... <br><br>A blinding brilliance overwhelmed the trio.<br><br>"Gods!" snapped Sadun. "I can't see!"<br><br>"Give it a moment," cautioned the sorcerer. "It will pass."<br><br>And so it did, but as his eyes adjusted, Norrec Vizharan at last beheld a sight so remarkable that he had to blink twice to make certain it was not a figment of his desires.<br><br>The walls were covered in intricate, jeweled patterns in which even he could sense the magic. Precious stones of every type and hue abounded in each pattern, blanketing the chamber in an astonishing display of refracted and reflected colors. In addition, below those magical symbols and no less eye-catching were the very treasures for which the trio had come. Mounds of gold, mounds of silver, mounds of jewels. They added to the overall glitter, making the chamber brighter than day. Each time either fighter shifted his torch, the lighting further altered the appearance of the room, adding new dimensions equally as startling as the last.<br><br>Yet, as breathtaking as all this looked, one shocking sight dampened Norrec's enthusiasm greatly.<br><br>Strewn across the floor as far as he could see were the many mangled and decaying forms of those who had preceded him and his friends to this foreboding place.<br><br>Sadun held his torch toward the nearest one, an almost fleshless corpse still clad in rotting leather armor. "Must've been some battle here."<br><br>"These men did not all die at the same time."<br><br>Norrec and the smaller soldier looked to Fauztin, who had a troubled expression on his generally emotionless countenance.<br><br>"What's that you mean?"<br><br>"I mean, Sadun, that some of them have clearly been dead for far longer, even centuries. This one near your feet is one of the newest. Some of those over there are but bones."<br><br>The slight warrior shrugged. "Either way, from the looks of it, they all died pretty nasty."<br><br>"There is that."<br><br>"So...what killed them?"<br><br>Here Norrec answered. "Look there. I think they slew each other."<br><br>The two corpses he pointed at each had blades thrust into one another's midsections. One, with his mouth still open in what seemed a last, horrified cry, wore garments akin to the other mummified body by Sadun's feet. The other wore only scraps of clothing and only a few strands of hair covered an otherwise clean skeleton.<br><br>"You must be mistaken," the Vizjerei replied with a slight shake of his head. "The one warrior is clearly much older than the other."<br><br>So Norrec would have supposed if not for the blade thrust into the other corpse's torso. Still, the deaths of two men long, long ago had little bearing on present circumstances. "Fauztin, do you sense anything? Is there some sort of trap here?"<br><br>The gaunt figure held his staff before the chamber for a moment, then lowered it again, his disgust quite evident. "There are too many conflicting forces in here, Norrec. I can get no accurate sense of what to seek. I sense nothing directly dangerous -- yet."<br><br>To the side, Sadun fairly hopped about in impatience. "So do we leave all of this, leave all our dreams, or do we take a little risk and gather ourselves a few empires' worth of coin?"<br><br>Norrec and the sorcerer e...</p><h2>Laidlaw</h2><p>The novel in which the unconventional detective Jack Laidlaw makes his debut.

Now, in a new book filled with warmth and honesty, she turns her attention to those continuing journeys of self-discovery and fulfillment that are part of every womans life. Filled with her own heartfelt and revealing stories, Necessary Journeys illuminates the joys and challenges of womens everyday lives, and shows us how every experience can be an opportunity for emotional and spiritual growth. At the heart of this book are the real issues women ages 35-60 confront, no matter which path they have chosen.</p><p>"I never expected life to be so messy," says Nancy Snyderman, medical news correspondent for <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>20/20</i>, and <i>ABC News</i>, in the opening to <i>Necessary Journeys</i>. Here she tells her own story--not a glittery story of a woman's achievements (though she could have written that story instead), but a raw one of "those parts of our lives that have influenced and shaped us without enriching our spirits." We read about Snyderman's rape as a college sophomore by a man wielding a knife at her throat, and how she didn't tell anyone for two years. We read about her depression, weight gain, and fear following that incident. She was also later diagnosed with "a rare form of lymph node cancer, which very few people survive." After 72 hours of tests and expert consultations, she learned that what she actually had was not cancer but a tick-borne virus. Snyderman learned firsthand the panic and isolation of a cancer diagnosis--"the stripping away of self ... the desperate dependence on the intelligence and training of strangers"--and she also experienced a speedy reprieve. The combination of the two made her a better and more compassionate doctor. We also share her experience of marrying a man who spent all her money, led a double life, and put her into devastating debt.<p> We also hear the happy stories--people who inspired her, her beginnings in television, adopting a baby--but what grip us are the shadow sides of her life. "By telling this story, I make sense of the senseless," writes Snyderman. By juxtaposing her stories with her current understanding, Snyderman passes along worthy advice for others facing similarly overwhelming situations. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>Nancy L. Snyderman.

He sets out on a journey, promising to return only if he can find three people sillier than they are. In rapid succession, he meets an old woman who insists on grazing her cow on the roof, a man with a highly unusual way of donning his trousers, and an entire village of moonstruck fools. He returns to marry and suffers a near (but predictable) tragedy; a resultant pint-sized silly promises a lifetime of outrageous adventures. Kellogg's ink-and-watercolor illustrations are wonderfully suited to the goofy goings-on. From full-page spreads to small boxed action sequences, the bumptious characters and talking animals engage in glorious mayhem. The many visual references to previous stories by Kellogg will delight fans. While the telling itself is simple and straightforward, the dialogue balloons and plentiful asides add greatly to the humor. Kathryn Hewitt's porcine version (Harcourt, 1989) and Paul Galdone's classic (Clarion, 1981) are sedate compared to this rollicking good time. Best shared one-on-one so the myriad details will not be missed.<br><i>Carol Ann Wilson, Westfield Memorial Library, NJ </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kellogg (Paul Bunyan; Johnny Appleseed) here serves up a rollicking farce inspired by a selection from Joseph Jacobs's 19th-century English Fairy Tales, with roots in the Brothers Grimm's "Clever Else." The narrative tells of a gentleman who is courting a farmer's daughter. When first the suitor's sweetheart, then her parents, disappear into the cellar one by one, he discovers the trio "A-sobbing and a-screeching and a-swimming in the cellar full of cider" (for quite a silly reason). He then sets out on horseback to "find three sillies who are even sillier than you three," and after he does, he returns to marry the daughter. Kellogg exploits the oddball scenarios to the fullest as he portrays an old woman trying to boost her cow onto her cottage roof ("to eat the weeds that were a-growing there") and a group of "a-whining, a-whimpering, and a-wailing" villagers who, spying the moon's reflection in a pond, believe it has tumbled from the sky. His riotous ink and watercolor illustrations spill over with preposterous particulars, including the antics and wisecracks of assorted opinionated animals. Presented in balloons, rhyming commentary from a boisterous chorus of townsfolk adds to the cheerful mayhem. Ages 5-10.

The direction he trailblazed was the "creation of television programming that spoke, with respect, to the concerns of early childhood, not as adults see it but as children feel it."<p>He has received virtually every major award in the television industry for work in his field, and dozens of others from special-interest groups.</p><p>Fred Rogers lives in Pennsylvania.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Grade 1-3-Rogers deals with the concerns, questions, and confusion children may have about people with special needs. He begins by describing common feelings they experience when they meet someone with a disability, such as curiosity, fear, or surprise. Readers are reassured that these reactions are normal and that getting to know individuals is the best way to understand and appreciate them. Although the author repeats some of the same advice found in his Adoption (1995), Divorce (1996) and Stepfamilies (1997, all Putnam)-for example, how helpful it is for children to talk to grown-ups about their feelings-this book also offers gentle suggestions for becoming friends with "extraordinary" people. Bright, colorful photographs depict six children with special needs in various situations. The first page introduces them and some of the things they like. Although the large-print text is easy to read, the book is best shared aloud as discussion is bound to follow.<br><i>Christine Lindsey, Lake Superior Primary School, Ashland, WI </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Winter Vegetarian: A Warm and Versatile Bounty</h2><p><p>With a true love for winter's culinary delights, Darra Goldstein's <em>The Winter Vegetarian</em> will make you long for the winter months year-round. Containing recipes from cold-climate cuisines all over the world, here is a creative and inspired collection that offers healthful and flavorful meals for any winter occasion.</p><p>From lusty Turkish Lentil Soup to spicy Basque-Style Scrambled Eggs to Ginger Pear Preserves, more than 150 delicious recipes--appetizers, salads, breads, desserts, and even Tolstoy's favorites--will help you face the challenge of remaining meat-free in the face of an often uninspiring produce department. With <em>The Winter Vegetarian,</em>yur meals will become the backdrop for a true appreciation of winter's rhythm as you luxuriate in the comforts of hearth and home. </p></p><p>A meatless cookbook devoted to wintry food that is lush and engaging is unexpected, to say the least. <i>The Winter Vegetarian</i> (formerly titled <i>The Vegetarian Hearth</i>) offers a wealth of earthy, flavorful dishes fitting this description. Darra Goldstein, a professor of Russian, focuses here on northern European climes, where foods suited to cold weather abound. To Goldstein, winter is not a time of limitation, lacking in appealing vegetables, but an opportunity to enjoy bold-tasting vegetables made sweeter by the chilling breath of a hard frost. Many chapters open with literate, scholarly essays ranging from a meditation on buckwheat and an exploration of the customs of Shrove Tuesday to a defense of rutabagas. <p> The recipes make sustaining fare. Finnish Cabbage Pie Soup, a rich, roasted-vegetable broth ladled over a flaky crust filled with meltingly saut�ed cabbage, is an unexpected, tempting dish. Other dishes are as simple as Spicy Winter Crudit�s, steeped in a cumin-accented marinade; warm, velvety roasted chestnuts; and comforting Basque Piperade, saut�ed sweet peppers and tomatoes stirred with moist scrambled eggs. (Goldstein relates this dish to a wintry state of mind found even in sunny Italy and France when the season turns bleak.) Anyone not seduced by the dark tapestry of winter flavors woven by Goldstein's way with turnips, cabbage, roasted sweet potatoes, dried apricots, and other winterized fruits can start with something more familiar like bran muffins or Hot Snow, South African mashed potatoes seasoned with ginger, lemon, and rosemary. After that, you may be ready to try the tangy, mustard-dressed Rutabaga Salad... and enjoy it. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p><p>Darra Goldstein is Professor of Russian at Williams College.

Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67.<p>She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in <b>Fantastic/Amazing Stories</b> in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to <b>Vortex Science Fiction</b>. She wrote everything from science fiction to Gothics, but is probably best known for her <b>Darkover</b> novels.</p><p>In addition to her novels, Mrs. Bradley edited many magazines, amateur and professional, including <b>Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine</b>, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called <b>Sword and Sorceress</b> for DAW Books.</p><p>Over the years she turned more to fantasy; The House Between the Worlds, although a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club, was "fantasy undiluted".

Margaret Alton is trying to master her gifts and the Shadow Matrix; Mikhail Lanart-Hastur, her lover, is on a wild-goose chase, courtesy of his uncle, Lord Regis Hastur; Mikhail's mother is fussing; and the lovers are trying to overcome political and family objections to their marriage. Just as they are up to their hindquarters in alligators, they are flung back to the Age of Chaos, in which Varzil the Good acts as a sort of deus ex machina to tie up several loose ends and generate others. The whole plot has a certain melodramatic, even operatic, quality, but the pacing is brisk, the setting is well handled, and the book succeeds at the most basic level of keeping the reader--particularly the hard-core Darkover reader--turning the pages. The characters sometimes indulge in illogical angst, and the Terran Empire, showing its invincible stupidity in handling Darkover, remains something of a straw villain. Bradley's saga is clearly showing some signs of age, but Darkover remains a monumental achievement, one that seems likely to spur more than a few additional good tales from its creator. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Death Du Jour</h2><p>Another day, another death... The internationally bestselling follow-up to Deja Dead, the prizewinning debut novel by expert forensic anthropologist and author, Kathy Reichs</p><p><i>"In Quebec, winters can be slow for the forensic anthropologist. The temperature rarely rises above freezing. The rivers and lakes ice over, the ground turns rock hard, and snow buries everything. Bugs disappear, and many scavengers go underground. The result: Corpses do not putrefy in the great outdoors. Floaters are not pulled from the St. Lawrence... and some of last season's dead are not found until the spring melt."</i><p> Readers of Kathy Reichs's cool and clever first forensic thriller <i>D�j� Dead</i> will recognize the ironic voice of Tempe (short for Temperance) Brennan, the North Carolina-born scientist who winds up working at the Laboratoire de M�dicine L�gale in Montreal. Here she bristles at the conservative attitudes of some of her Canadian colleagues. </p><p> Despite the cold weather, Tempe's workload quickly becomes heavy: the bones of a long-dead nun now up for sainthood have been moved and tampered with; a deadly house fire turns out to be arson; and a university teaching assistant disappears after joining a cult. Tempe must figure out where (and why) all the bodies are buried in the hard Canadian ground. Her investigations take her home to North Carolina, and to a strange colony living on an offshore island. </p><p> Unlike certain other writers who specialize in forensic pathology, Reichs doesn't revel in the horror of death or rub our noses in gore: she uses the science of death to reveal rather than to shock or startle.

In compiling this revised edition the authors revisited all the domaines that appeared in previous editions plus scores of &#39;rising stars&#39;, to select the very best and most interesting of them-and remove those that no longer come up to scratch. They have spoken to winemakers about their grapes, soil, and techniques-and, of course, sampled their wines.

Presented in the form of pithy statements, this text documents the entire philosophical system of Yoga in four logically arranged chapters. The aphorisms are simple in their rendering, yet pregnant with layers of meaning. The profound worth of this work has kept it alive through history, and every succeeding master of Yoga has always considered the Yogas�tra as the definitive source of reference. Despite its intrinsic value in guiding people for so many generations, the genius of Pata�jali is not easy to comprehend, especially for the casual reader. This is why so many translations and commentaries on the Yogas�tra have been written by great teachers, each offering different insights into its rich teachings. Liberating Isolation is an English translation and commentary on the Yogasutra by Frans Moors, a long time pupil of the renowned Yogacharya TKV Desikachar. It presents the essence of Yoga philosophy to international readers, and features the aphorisms in both the classical and simplified forms in Devan�gar� script, their transliterated version, word-to-word meaning, and a concise translation and commentary. The text also includes a comprehensive word index to aid readers in their reference and studies, and a booklet with chant notations.</p><p></p><h2>ESL Phonics for All Ages (Book 1: Beginning Consonants)</h2><p>Part of a 6 book series designed both for English language learners who read in a non_Roman alphabet native language and for English learners who cannot read in any language.</p><p></p><h2>DC SUPER HEROES: MY FIRST BOOK OF GIRL POWER (8)</h2><p>A celebration of girl power for budding super heroines featuring beloved DC characters from Wonder Woman to Batgirl.<br><br>Exploring attributes from physical strength to intuition, this introduction to DC's super heroines is also a catalog of role models for little girls.

His first job was with Reuters news agency, followed by a brief spell as a stockbroker. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was appointed assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral Godfrey, where he played a key part in British and Allied espionage operations. After the war he joined Kemsley Newspapers as Foreign Manager of the Sunday Times, running a network of correspondents who were intimately involved in the Cold War. His first novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953 and introduced James Bond, Special Agent 007, to the world. The first print run sold out within a month. Following this initial success, he published a Bond title every year until his death. His own travels, interests and wartime experience gave authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler hailed him as `the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#39; The fifth title, From Russia with Love, was particularly well received and sales soared when President Kennedy named it as one of his favourite books. The Bond novels have sold more than sixty million copies and inspired a hugely successful film franchise which began in 1962 with the release of Dr No starring Sean Connery as 007. The Bond books were written in Jamaica, a country Fleming fell in love with during the war and where he built a house, `Goldeneye&#39;. He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only child Caspar, went on to become the well-loved novel and film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Fleming died of heart failure on 12 August 1964, aged fifty-six. www.ianfleming.com<p>1. <b>FROM A VIEW TO A KILL</b></p> <p>The eyes behind the wide black rubber goggles were cold as flint. In the howling speed-turmoil of a BSA M20 doing seventy, they were the only quiet things in the hurtling flesh and metal. Protected by the glass of the goggles, they stared fixedly ahead from just above the centre of the handlebars, and their dark, unwavering focus was that of gun muzzles. Below the goggles, the wind had got into the face through the mouth and had wrenched the lips back into a square grin that showed big tombstone teeth and strips of whitish gum. On both sides of the grin the cheeks had been blown out by the wind into pouches that fluttered slightly. To right and left of the hurtling face under the crash helmet, the black gauntlets, broken-wristed at the controls, looked like the attacking paws of a big animal.</p> <p>The man was dressed in the uniform of a dispatch-rider in the Royal Corps of Signals, and his machine, painted olive green, was, with certain modifications to the valves and the carburettor and the removal of some of the silencer baffles to give more speed, identical with a standard British Army machine. There was nothing in the man or his equipment to suggest that he was not what he appeared to be, except a fully loaded Luger held by a clip to the top of the petrol tank.</p> <p>It was seven o'clock on a May morning and the dead straight road through the forest glittered with the tiny luminous mist of spring. On both sides of the road the moss- and flower- carpeted depths between the great oak trees held the theatrical enchantment of the royal forests of Versailles and St Germain. The road was D98, a secondary road serving local traffic in the St Germain area, and the motorcyclist had just passed beneath the Paris-Mantes autoroute already thundering with commuter traffic for Paris. He was heading north towards St Germain and there was no one else in sight in either direction, except, perhaps half a mile ahead, an almost identical figure - another Royal Corps dispatch-rider. He was a younger, slimmer man and he sat com-fortably back on his machine, enjoying the morning and keeping his speed to around forty. He was well on time and it was a beautiful day. He wondered whether to have his eggs fried or scrambled when he got back to HQ around eight.</p> <p>Five hundred yards, four hundred, three, two, one. The man coming up from behind slowed to fifty. He put his right gauntlet up to his teeth and pulled it off. He stuffed the gauntlet between the buttons of his tunic and reached down and unclipped the gun.</p> <p>By now he must have been big in the driving-mirror of the young man ahead, for suddenly the young man jerked his head round, surprised to find another dispatch-rider on his run at that time of the morning. He expected that it would be an American or perhaps French military police. It might be anyone from the eight NATO nations that made up the staff of SHAPE, but when he recognized the uniform of the Corps he was astonished and delighted. Who the hell could it be? He raised a cheerful right thumb in recognition and cut his speed to thirty, waiting for the other man to drift up alongside. With one eye on the road ahead and the other on the approaching silhouette in the mirror, he ran through the names of the British riders in the Special Service Transportation Unit at Headquarters Command. Albert, Sid, Wally - might be Wally, same thick build. Good show! He'd be able to pull his leg about that little frog bit in the canteen - Louise, Elise, Lise - what the hell was her name. &#x2014; The man with the gun had slowed. Now he was fifty yards away. His face, undistorted by the wind, had set into blunt, hard, perhaps Slav lines. A red spark burned behind the black, aimed muzzles of the eyes. Forty yards, thirty. A single magpie flew out of the forest ahead of the young dispatch-rider. It fled clumpsily across the road into the bushes behind a Michelin sign that said that St Germain was one kilometre to go. The young man grinned and raised an ironical finger in salute and self-protection - 'One magpie is sorrow'. &#x2014; Twenty yards behind him the man with the gun took both hands off the handlebars, lifted the Luger, rested it carefully on his left forearm and fired one shot. &#x2014; The young man's hands whipped off his controls and met across the centre of his backward-arching spine. His machine veered across the road, jumped a narrow ditch and ploughed into a patch of grass and lilies of the valley. There it rose up on its screaming back wheel and slowly crashed backwards on top of its dead rider. The BSA coughed and kicked and tore at the young man's clothes and at the flowers, and then lay quiet. &#x2014; The killer executed a narrow turn and stopped with his machine pointing back the way he had come. He stamped down the wheel-rest, pulled his machine up on to it and walked in among the wild flowers under the trees. He knelt down beside the dead man and brusquely pulled back an eyelid. Just as roughly he tore the black leather dispatch-case off the corpse and ripped open the buttons of the tunic and removed a battered leather wallet. He wrenched a cheap wristwatch so sharply off the left wrist that the chrome expanding bracelet snapped in half. He stood up and slung the dispatch-case over his shoulder. While he stowed the wallet and the watch away in his tunic pocket he listened. There were only forest sounds and the slow tick of hot metal from the crashed BSA. The killer retraced his steps to the road. He walked slowly, scuffing leaves over the tyre marks in the soft earth and moss. He took extra trouble over the deep scars in the ditch and the grass verge, and then stood beside his motor-cycle and looked back towards the lily of the valley patch. Not bad! Probably only the police dogs would get it, and, with ten miles of road to cover, they would be hours, perhaps days - plenty long enough. The main thing in these jobs was to have enough safety margin. He could have shot the man at forty yards, but he had preferred to get to twenty. And taking the watch and the wallet had been nice touches - pro touches.</p> <p>Pleased with himself, the man heaved his machine off its rest, vaulted smartly into the saddle and kicked down on the starter. Slowly, so as not to show skid marks, he accelerated away back down the road and in a minute or so he was doing seventy again and the wind had redrawn the empty turnip grin across his face.</p> <p>Around the scene of the killing, the forest, which had held its breath while it was done, slowly began to breathe again. James Bond had his first drink of the evening at Fouquet's. It was not a solid drink. One cannot drink seriously in French cafes. Out of doors on a pavement in the sun is no place for vodka or whisky or gin. A fine a 1'eau is fairly serious, but it intoxicates without tasting very good. A quart de champagne or a champagne a I'orange is all right before luncheon, but in the evening one quart leads to another quart and a bottle of indif-ferent champagne is a bad foundation for the night. Pernod is possible, but it should be drunk in company, and anyway Bond had never liked the stuff because its liquorice taste reminded him of his childhood. No, in cafes you have to drink the least offensive of the musical comedy drinks that go with them, and Bond always had the same thing - an Americano - Bitter Campari, Cinzano, a large slice of lemon peel and soda. For the soda he always stipulated Perrier, for in his opinion expensive soda water was the cheapest way to improve a poor drink.</p> <p>When Bond was in Paris he invariably stuck to the same addresses. He stayed at the Terminus Nord, because he liked station hotels and because this was the least pretentious and most anonymous of them. He had luncheon at the Cafe de la Paix, the Rotonde or the Dome, because the food was good enough and it amused him to watch the people. If he wanted a solid drink he had it at Harry's Bar, both because of the solidity of the drinks and because, on his first ignorant visit to Paris at the age of sixteen, he had done what Harry's advertise-ment in the Continental Daily Mail had told him to do and had said to his taxi-driver 'Sank Roo Doe Noo'. That had started one of the memorable evenings of his life, culminating in the loss, almost simultaneous, of his virginity and his notecase. For dinner. Bond went to one of the great restaurants - Vefour, the Caneton, Lucas-Carton or the Cochon d'Or. These he considered, whatever Michelin might say about the Tour d'Argent, Maxims and the like, to have somehow avoided the tarnish of the expense account and the dollar. Anyway, he preferred their cooking. After dinner he generally went to the Place Pigalle to see what would happen to him.

He was on his way through Paris after a dismally failed assignment on the Austro-Hungarian border. It had been a question of getting a certain Hungarian out. Bond had been sent from London specially to direct the operation over the head of Station V. This had been unpopular with the Vienna Station. There had been misunderstandings - wilful ones. The man had been killed in the frontier minefield. There would have to be a court of inquiry. Bond was due back at his London headquarters on the following day to make his report, and the thought of it all depressed him. Today had been so beautiful -one of those days when you almost believe that Paris is beautiful and gay - and Bond had decided to give the town just one more chance. He would somehow find himself a girl who was a real girl, and he would take her to dinner at some make-believe place in the Bois like the Armenonville. To clean the money-look out of her eyes - for it would certainly be there - he would as soon as possible give her fifty thousand francs. He would say to her: 'I propose to call you Donatienne, or possibly Solange, because these are names that suit my mood and the evening.

Often the altar is decorated, but almost always in the same way; with flowers, candles, or a cross. But what if the altar could be made a more integral part of the worship experience? What if the visual elements on the altar could be designed to fit in with that Sunday&#x2019;s scriptures, hymns, prayers, and sermon? And what if it could be done, not only beautifully, but simply and inexpensively, so that churches of any size could benefit from this enhancement to their worship? That is just what Nancy Townley and Stephanie Davis are offering in this helpful and practical book. Worship leaders and artists, they have assembled dozens of beautiful, worshipful altar designs, pictures of which appear in the book. Along with these pictures are detailed instructions, not simply on how to create the design, but how and where to find or purchase the component elements with the least effort and expense. Designed with the needs of small membership and mid-size churches in mind, this volume offers indispensable guidance for anyone who wants to make worship a more enriching and transforming experience. <p>Nancy C.

Current data from the Centers for Disease Control reveal a 41 percent increase in rates of ADHD diagnoses over the past decade and a forty-fold spike in bipolar disorder diagnoses. Similarly, diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, once considered, has increased by 78 percent since 2002.<br><br> Dr. Enrico Gnaulati, a clinical psychologist specializing in childhood and adolescent therapy and assessment, has witnessed firsthand the push to diagnose these disorders in youngsters. Drawing both on his own clinical experience and on cutting-edge research, with <i>Back to Normal </i>he has written the definitive account of why our kids are being dramatically overdiagnosed&#x2014;and how parents and professionals can distinguish between true psychiatric disorders and normal childhood reactions to stressful life situations. <br><br> Gnaulati begins with the complex web of factors that have led to our current crisis. These include questionable education and training practices that cloud mental health professionals&#x2019; ability to distinguish normal from abnormal behavior in children, monetary incentives favoring prescriptions, check-list diagnosing, and high-stakes testing in schools. We&#x2019;ve also developed an increasingly casual attitude about labeling kids and putting them on psychiatric drugs.&nbsp; <br><br> So how do we differentiate between a child with, say, Asperger&#x2019;s syndrome and a child who is simply introverted, brainy, and single-minded? As Gnaulati notes, many of the symptoms associated with these disorders are similar to everyday childhood behaviors. In the second half of the book Gnaulati tells detailed stories of wrongly diagnosed kids, providing parents and others with information about the developmental, temperamental, and environmentally driven symptoms that to a casual or untrained eye can mimic a psychiatric disorder.&nbsp;These stories also reveal how nonmedical interventions, whether in the therapist&#x2019;s office or through changes made at home, can help children.<br><br> <i>Back to Normal</i> reminds us of the normalcy of children&#x2019;s seemingly abnormal behavior. It will give parents of struggling children hope, perspective, and direction. And it will make everyone who deals with children question the changes in our society that have contributed to the astonishing increase in childhood psychiatric diagnoses.</p><p><b>Enrico Gnaulati</b> is a clinical psychologist based in Pasadena, California. His work has been featured on <i>Al Jazeera America</i>, KPCC Los Angeles, and online at the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Salon</i>.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is about the normalcy of children&#x2019;s seemingly abnormal behavior. Mostly, I wrote it to give parents of struggling children hope, perspective, and direction. However, I also wrote it to counteract the pervasive tendency in our society to medicalize children&#x2019;s behavior and to categorize an increasing array of normal childhood reactions to stressful life situations as proof positive of a psychiatric diagnosis. Critics of American society insist that we are a nation of people who overpsychologize. Yet nowadays, when it comes to understanding children&#x2019;s behavior, clearly we underpsychologize. We shy away from trusting our own ability to decipher the ordinary human meanings, motives, and developmental reasons for why children act the way they do. This book aims to correct this imbalance.<br> &nbsp;<br> While working as a psychologist with children and families for the past twenty-five years, I&#x2019;ve observed that parents are nothing short of desperate for answers that will help them to tease apart whether their kid has transitory problems or is showing signs of a diagnosable condition. The truth is, it&#x2019;s exceedingly difficult to distinguish between, on the one hand, things like a lag in social and emotional growth, a mismatch between where a kid is developmentally and what is expected of him or her at school, patterns of emotional reactivity in the parent-child relationship, a difficult personality trait, or a perfect storm of all of these and, on the other hand, evidence of a psychiatric condition like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), bipolar disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. Yet when we look at the number of kids with these disorders, we get the impression that it&#x2019;s exceedingly easy.<br> &nbsp;<br> As we&#x2019;ll see, ADHD is thought to be as prevalent as the common cold, with 1 in 10 children meriting the diagnosis&#x2014;about as many children as use cold remedies at any given time. &nbsp;Figures out of the famed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 1 in 54 boys and 1 in 252 girls have autism spectrum disorder, while bipolar disorder among youth has undergone a fortyfold increase in the past decade.<br> &nbsp;What explains these sky-high numbers?<br> &nbsp;<br> Part of the answer lies in how similar many of the symptoms associated with these disorders are to everyday childhood behaviors. This can make the diagnostic process overly subjective and thereby slant it in the direction of doctors and therapists yielding false positives. Take attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We can see shades of all children in the core symptoms of ADHD: distractibility, forgetfulness, problems with follow-through, not listening, talking excessively, fidgetiness, and difficulty waiting one&#x2019;s turn. Sophisticated clinical language characterizing autism spectrum disorder, such as &#x201c;deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing and maintaining age-appropriate relationships,&#x201d; really boils down to run-of-the-mill behaviors like showing yourself to be happy when someone else is happy, keeping good eye contact, responding to your name, and finding other kids your age interesting&#x2014;phenomena that toddlers, the youngsters most apt to be under the autism spectrum lens, often have difficulty mastering. Similarly, when a toddler repeats words and phrases, is entranced by stimulating objects, and has rigid food preferences, is he or she working through something developmentally or on the spectrum? The common criteria for bipolar disorder are hard to separate from evidence of a difficult adolescent passage: irritability, temper outbursts, moodiness, fluctuations in motivation, sleep irregularities, overconfidence, and a propensity to engage in risky behaviors. This is particularly true in our twenty-first-century media-saturated culture, where ready bedroom access to screens interferes with teenagers&#x2019; sleep, causing teens to be groggy and irritable, and where participation in social-network sites like Facebook almost requires them to be self-promotional.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another part of the answer for why these disorders are massively overdiagnosed lies in how casual we have become about incorporating mental health jargon into our everyday conversations. We pin diagnoses on ourselves as if they are faddish labels or give us outlaw celebrity status. &#x201c;ADHD&#x201d; happens to be the name of a song by the English alternative-rock band Blood Red Shoes, and the rapper Krizz Kaliko&#x2019;s hit &#x201c;Bipolar&#x201d; can be downloaded as a cell phone ringtone. It can seem cool to be bipolar when high-roller actors like Mel Gibson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and legendary rock stars like Axl Rose, refer to themselves that way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet there are good reasons to be cautious when it comes to these diagnoses. We may be remarkably casual about tossing around mental health labels, but unfortunately, studies show that the average American still harbors negative stereotypes about kids and teens with psychiatric disorders. Large swaths of the American public still believe that a depressed teenager is a would-be violent teenager. A mental health diagnosis can also follow a kid into adulthood and potentially disqualify him or her from careers in law enforcement, the military, and other professions; make it difficult to obtain a pilot&#x2019;s or trucker&#x2019;s license; and jack up life and disability insurance rates for him or her. And, of course, an easygoing attitude toward diagnosing can pave the way for uncritical consumption of medications, minimizing the undesirable side effects that often accompany their use.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story of how pharmaceutical companies oversell the general public on mental illness and medications to boost their profits is a story that has been told many times. However, I will retell the relevant parts of this tale, taking the reader behind the scenes to look at how pharmaceutical reps often drive doctors&#x2019; diagnostic habits, what recent research shows about the effectiveness of medications routinely used with children, and the latest ideas by leading scholars that call into question brain-based and chemical-imbalance theories of behavior. <br> &nbsp;<br> I also will tell another story, one that most parents probably haven&#x2019;t heard before. This story is about how doctors&#x2019; and therapists&#x2019; education and training primes them to think in terms of disease and disorder and often blinds them to humanistic, developmental, and commonsense explanations for children&#x2019;s troubling and troublesome behavior. I am a psychologist, so telling this story has been disquieting&#x2014;to say the least. When parents bring their child to me for help, I like to first consider the likelihood that the child is experiencing a stressful reaction to life events, but is otherwise normal. I am comfortable with the idea that there&#x2019;s great variation across children in the rate at which their social and emotional development unfolds. Sometimes a child&#x2019;s troubles simply mean that he or she is slow to mature in an area and will do just fine with some combination of adjustments to his or her daily environments, targeted parenting interventions, and garden-variety talk and play therapy. I like to think in terms of normal human variation, developmental glitches, and wellness. This is not to say that I don&#x2019;t go into high gear when, over time, after an assortment of interventions, there is unquestionable evidence that a child has a disabling psychiatric condition and needs medication and other, more rigorous interventions. Sadly, however, when it comes to children&#x2019;s mental health, this way of thinking is not widely shared by doctors and therapists. Often parents face overwhelming pressure to medicalize and medicate their kid&#x2019;s behavior from the get-go in doctors&#x2019; and therapists&#x2019; offices. I want parents to be aware of the larger forces influencing the field of children&#x2019;s mental health.<br> &nbsp;<br> One issue I address is why boys are far more likely to be perceived as behaviorally disturbed than girls, and what parents of sons can do about it. As a father of a son, I&#x2019;m particularly sensitive to this issue. I see my son and quite a few other males his age act squirrelly, roughhouse, shun reading, stuff homework into messy backpacks, clam up verbally unless they have a shared activity to pursue or technical topic to discuss, and be quick to react when their pride is injured. Such observations give me a firm grounding in what&#x2019;s normal. I&#x2019;m thankful for that grounding. It has helped me to see more clearly how, as politically incorrect as it may sound, our understanding of &#x201c;normal&#x201d; behavior for children has become feminized. We tend to judge boys using standards of behavior applicable to the average girl, not the average boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another theme that I explore is how mental health symptoms sometimes are actually ancient, innate personality traits and coping mechanisms that have helped us adapt and survive as humans for thousands of years. Despite all the pathological talk about depression and mania, children and teens are capable of experiencing &#x201c;healthy depression&#x201d; and &#x201c;healthy mania.&#x201d; At manageable levels, depression and mania are time-honored human responses reflecting the brain&#x2019;s hardwired ways of helping us to cope with attachment and loss in relationships, as well as to energetically strive for success and greater social status. Symptoms such as anxiety, aggressiveness, and action-orientedness are personality traits that would have been highly adaptive during hunter-gatherer times, but which are a liability in today&#x2019;s &#x201c;chalk and talk&#x201d; classroom. I will share with the reader practical ways in which kids&#x2019; everyday environments can be changed in order to allow them to best adapt by making positive use of such inborn personality traits.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I set about writing this book, I knew that I wanted it to contain ample stories to which readers could relate. I wanted to describe the behavior of children who may be difficult, but who are not suffering from psychiatric disorders, in such a way that a parent could see his or her own son or daughter in them. For instance, it was paramount for me to really bring alive how ADHD symptoms often mimic normal childhood narcissism and to provide remedies for parents dealing with their kids&#x2019; challenging developmental struggles. I labored to find evocative examples of the difference between true hyperactivity and a kid&#x2019;s habit of seeking needed attention and recognition in frenzied ways. I strove to highlight how sometimes a pattern of failing to finish tasks has little to do with a disordered brain and more to do with a child or teen approaching tasks with &#x201c;magical thinking&#x201d; about what can be accomplished. Similarly, I wanted to show how forgetfulness can sometimes be nothing more than a kid&#x2019;s underpracticing and underpreparing because he or she is overconfident. These scenarios, I thought, would help a parent discern whether his or her own child actually was afflicted with a disorder or was stressed for other reasons.<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt it was necessary to include longer case descriptions in order for readers to confidently grasp the finer points of children&#x2019;s expectable, troubling reactions given their personalities and life circumstances, as compared with signs of a true psychiatric condition such as bipolar disorder. Readers will be introduced to seventeen-year-old Brandon, whose bipolar rages are best explained in terms of the harmful ways he deals with his tendency toward shame and the emotional flooding and reactivity that flares up when he and his mother are in conflict. Readers will also meet William, who was falsely diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age five. His case rather dramatically shows how brainy, introverted, individualistically minded boys with a passion for ideas and strong needs for interpersonal control can get mislabeled as autistic in their younger years.<br> &nbsp;<br> In all the case snippets and studies that I&#x2019;ve included, I changed names and disguised factual information for confidentiality reasons. But essential phenomena, meanings, and outcomes have been preserved. At no time do I use purely fictional accounts.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve concentrated on success stories. These are the kids in my practice who appeared to be poster children for major psychiatric disorders when I first met them, but with family lifestyle changes, parenting interventions, play and talk therapy, and the passage of time, did not merit any such diagnosis. These sorts of cases are not rare. The reader will be reassured to learn about scientific evidence showing that upwards of a third of teenagers diagnosed with bipolar disorder are no longer diagnosable as bipolar by their mid- to late twenties and that approximately one in five toddlers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder prior to age three don&#x2019;t meet the diagnosis when assessed a few years later. A National Institute of Mental Health study even shows that three-quarters of ADHD children outgrow their condition by the time they reach their midtwenties.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lastly, at the end of the book, in a nonblaming, reasonable, highly practical way, I lay out dozens of strategies, tips, and lifestyle changes that parents can utilize to foster self-discipline, even-temperedness, and greater social competence in their kids. Guidelines are included for when to consider pursuing outside professional help and what to look for in a therapist.<br> &nbsp;<br> My guess is that you picked up this book because you sympathize with the notion that as a society we have become too casual medicalizing and abnormalizing children&#x2019;s behavior. Chances are you eagerly wish to build your knowledge base of commonsense psychological and developmental explanations for children&#x2019;s emotional issues. Maybe you&#x2019;re a parent who is perplexed and exasperated by your child&#x2019;s wayward behavior. You urgently desire a deeper understanding of why your child behaves in a maddening way and what can be done about it. You want your child diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder only if he or she really has one. If you are aided by my book, the countless hours I have spent poring over research literature and magazine articles, reflecting on my work with clients, and taking solo writing trips on retreat in the desert at Joshua Tree, California, will have been well worth it.</p><h2>A Possibility of Violence: A Novel (Avraham Avraham Series, 2)</h2><p><p>Haunted by the past and his own limitations, Israeli Detective Avraham Avraham must stop a criminal ruthless enough to target children in this evocative and gripping tale of mystery and psychological suspense that is the follow-up to <em>The Missing File</em>, the acclaimed first novel in D.

My teacher, don Juan Matsus, said this is guiding me as his apprentice to collect what I considered to be the memorable events of my life.... Don Juan described the total goal of the shamanistic knowledge that he handled as the preparation for facing the <em>definitive journey:</em> the journey that every human being has to take at the end of his life. He said that what modern man referred to vaguely as life after death was, for those shamans, a concrete region filled to capacity with practical affairs of a different order than the practical affairs of daily life, yet bearing a similar functional practicality. Don Juan considered that to collect the memorable in their lives was, for shamans, the preparation for their entrance into that concrete region, which they called the <em>active side of infinity."</em></p><p>In this book written immediately before his death, anthropologist and shaman Carlos Castaneda gives us his most autobiographical and intimately revealing work ever, the fruit of a lifetime of experience and perhaps the most moving volume in his oeuvre.</p></p><p>Carlos Castaneda was the author of the bestselling books, including the acknowledged classic <em>The Teaching of Don Juan</em> and most recently <em>The Art of Dreaming</em> and <em>Magical Passes.</em> He departed on his definitive journey in 1998.Dense, narcissistic musings on death and the shaman's life. Onetime anthropologist Castaneda has built a three-decade career out of relaying the teachings of his Yaqui Indian mentor, Juan Matus, in works ranging from The Teachings of Don Juan (196 8) to 1993's The Art of Dreaming. Apparently, Castaneda feels that he has yet more wisdom to impart. Still, this vague assortment of personal vignettes offers little in the way of spiritual guidance. Paradoxically, although Don Juan often tells Castaneda that a sorcerer must be emptied of self to accept infinity (annoyingly, this latter word is always italicized in the text), the book seems self-absorbed from the start. In preparation for accepting infinity, true, Castaneda must revisit some of the most p ivotal events in his life. A few of the stories are hopelessly sad (and one relentlessly misogynist). One of the most touching occurs when Don Juan urges Castaneda to track down the two women who helped him when he was a very young man. Castaneda is instr ucted to reward themwhile rendering himself pennilesswith an extravagant gift. And one of the women, now a homemaker with three kids, is indeed overjoyed to receive a top-of-the-line station wagon. Yet it's hard to find a larger meaning in the stories. We wind up learning something more of Castaneda but not much at all about the active side of infinity, which is mystically translated as ``intent.'' It appears that we ought to live with intent, never forgetting that we will die, regardless. Death (and the knowledge of it) should thus inform all of our actions and relationships, providing a perspective and enforcing our humility. This is hardly an original idea, and it cant justify wading through Castanedas welter of self-indulgence, which might translate b etter to a bumper-sticker adage. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

These magical dolls are full of character and are amazingly easy to achieve with the help of this practical book. Step-by-step instructions are provided for all the basic techniques, including how to make the bodies, heads, arms, legs, hands and feet; how to make the hair; and how to needlesculpt and paint the exquisite faces to really bring your character to life. There are instructions for making webbed fingers, delicate fairy wings as well as a mermaid&#39;s tail, and there are three easy-to-follow projects to put all your newly acquired skills into practice. Jan encourages the reader to use their imagination and create dolls of their own, and the alternative designs that accompany each project show how easily this can be done simply by changing the faces, colours, fabrics and embellishments used.</p><p>Jan Horrox&#39;s career began in 1973 when she gained a Diploma in Fashion/Textile Design from North East London Polytechnic. She went on to establish her own range of fashion knitwear that she designed and manufactured herself, and which sold to reputable stores as well as independent customers in the US, UK and Japan. Jan also taught part-time at various colleges in the UK, and in 2004 she set up Jan Horrox Cloth Dolls. She now sells doll-making supplies via her successful on-line business, as well as exhibiting her wok regularly throughout the UK. Jan lives and works in Norfolk. www.jan-horrox.comJune 13 Using clear, step-by-step instructions and gorgeous photographs, Jan Horrox shows you how to make exquisitely crafted fantasy dolls, including magical fairies, mermaids, a witch, and a steampunk doll. Detailed instructions are provided on how to sculpt and colour the face; form hands, feet, wings and mermaids&#39; tails; and create fabulous costumes using a variety of fabrics, paints and embellishments. Full-size templates for all the body parts are provided at the back of the book. * Merseyside Embroiderer&#39;s Guild (megonline.co.uk) * Nov 13 Cloth dolls are perfect for allowing you to explore your imagination and create intriguing, dreamlike figures from fabric and stitch. The dolls can be made exactly as shown or interpreted in your own style. The magical array of fantasy dolls that Jan Horrox has produced seem to consist of visitants from dreams or the Otherworld - both destinations where we are most free in our creativity and the power of the imagination is at its strongest. Jan gives anyone with basic sewing skills the opportunity to beckon these beautiful creatures out of your dreams and into everyday reality, where they can cast their spell and people your world. Creating a doll yourself is said to give it a soul - a bewitching thought! * Cygnus Review * Sept 13 The forte of this book is undoubtedly its clear and detailed instructions. This is Jan&#39;s second book on the subject. If like me, you find the dolls `ugly&#39; with their over-large eyes and lips, you can still use the instructions and change the face. In fact, with a little imagination you can change the pattern pieces too. Another great plus point is the fact that all the template pieces - the doll body parts, are actual size. The photography is fantastic showing many step by step instructions. The book shows all the fabrics, embellishments and techniques you need to use. Instructions are included for six fantasy dolls. I am happy to recommend this book to all doll makers for this reason. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts *</p><h2>Toyota: Fifty Years in Motion (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p>Eiji Toyoda signed below his photo in ballpoint pen on page opposite the title page.

After years of struggling asa writer in 1990s New York City, James Smale finally gets his big break when his novel sells to an editor at a major publishing house: none other than Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Jackie, or Mrs. Onassis as she&#39;s known in the office, has fallen in love with James&#39;s candidly autobiographical novel, one that exposes his own dysfunctional family. But when the book&#39;s forthcoming publication threatens to unravel already fragile relationships, both within his family and with his partner, James finds that he can&#39;t bring himself to finish the manuscript. Jackie and James develop an unexpected friendship, and she pushes him to write an authentic ending, encouraging him to head home to confront the truth about his relationship with his mother.

At turns equally laugh-out-loud funny and searingly poignant, Rowley has created a truly unforgettable story of a son trying to understand his mother. <i>The Editor</i> is one of those exceptional stories that is both a joy to read on every page and also deeply profound and significant. It took my breath away."<b>--Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of <i>Daisy Jones and the Six</i> </b> <p></p>"Told with warmth and humor, Steven Rowley's charming second novel tells the story of a mother-son reconciliation, facilitated by a most unlikely fairy godmother. <i>The Editor</i> offers a delightful fictional glimpse of an iconic American family--but it is, at heart, a tribute to every family whose last name isn't Kennedy."<b><b>--Chloe Benjamin, author of <i>The Immortalists</i></b></b> <p></p>"<i>The Editor</i> is an absolute triumph!

Keep tissues handy. I had to use a bedsheet."<b>--Julia Claiborne Johnson, author of </b><i><b>Be Frank With Me</b> <p></p></i>"<i>The Editor</i> is an absolute delight from start to finish.

At the moment of infection he was a famous and vigorous young man on the rise toward national leadership. The virus was small beyond imagining.<br> <br>Ten more years would go by before the first electron microscopes revealed that the poliovirus resembles a distant planet inscribed with tiny canyons. The virus is not alive in the way a bird is alive or even in the way a bacterium is alive. It is nothing more than a little sphere of fat enclosing a smaller strip of genetic material. It cannot move by itself. It does not eat or breathe. It is at most half-alive&#x2014;a parasite. To reproduce, it must enter a human body, then survive an onslaught from the protective machinery of the body&#x2019;s immune system, then blunder up against a welcoming cell in the human intestine. If the virus can burrow inside that cell, its fatty capsule dissolves, exposing the strip of genetic chemicals within. Then a bizarre meshing of genetic equipment ensues. Like the two sides of a zipper, the strip from the virus unites with a matching strip from the intestinal cell, forming an assembly line that begins to duplicate the original virus by the thousand. Overloaded, the cell bursts, the virus&#x2019;s progeny collide with neighboring intestinal cells, and the multiplication spreads.<br> <br>Even then, the effect of this submicrocosmic production would likely be negligible. Most of the virus&#x2019;s human hosts suffer nothing worse than a headache and a mild fever. The immune system overwhelms the virus and flushes it out of the body, and the human host goes on with life none the wiser.<br> <br>But in a fraction of those infected&#x2014;fewer than one percent&#x2014;the virus escapes from the intestinal tract into the central nervous system. It has an affinity for certain cells in the spinal cord that govern the movement of muscles. If the virus finds these cells, it destroys them&#x2014;sometimes only a few, sometimes a great many. The number of spinal-cord cells destroyed determines the fate of the human host. If only a few cells are destroyed, the host might be only temporarily hobbled, then recover completely. If a great many cells are destroyed, depending on their number and location, he might be left badly damaged or dead.<br> <br>Outside the human host, the virus can escape disintegration for as long as six months. To propagate&#x2014;its only purpose, if it can be said to have a purpose&#x2014;it must find its way into a susceptible human being. Its best chance of doing so comes in the heat of summer.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The whole Northeast had been roasting for days. In Rochester, New York, police were attributing a double murder and suicide to &#x201c;heat-craze.&#x201d; In New York City, the chief clerk of the Edison Electric Company collapsed of heat prostration and died. Inside Manhattan&#x2019;s Traffic Court, the magistrate allowed boys to roam through the courtrooms to sell lemonade. On 10th Street in Greenwich Village, members of Fire Engine Company 18 filled their portable water tank and waved the kids in&#x2014;dozens of sweaty boys in woolen pants, jostling and dunking each other, spitting and swallowing the cloudy water.<br> <br>So it was a good day to get out on the Hudson River, where at least there might be a breeze. And Franklin Roosevelt would seize any chance to get afloat. He loved the water. On his mother&#x2019;s side he was the scion of an old seafaring family. He had grown up sailing small boats on the mid-Hudson and among rocky islands of the northern seacoast. As a teenager his great ambition had been to attend the U.S. Naval Academy and command ships at sea. But his parents had said no, that his future lay among men like the ones he was joining for today&#x2019;s outing on the river: well-dressed, well-educated, well-heeled men of business, law, and government. All were friends of the Greater New York Council of the Boy Scouts of America, of which Roosevelt had just been elected chairman.<br> <br>He found them gathering just after lunch in the clubhouse of the Columbia Yacht Club, a pleasant, low building with broad porches and big windows on Riverside Drive at the foot of West 86th Street. They mingled in paneled rooms hung with lovely old naval prints like the ones in Roosevelt&#x2019;s own collection, one of the finest of its kind in the country. Soon the men moved to the pier outside, then boarded small boats to be ferried to the steam yacht Pocantico, pride of Barron G. Collier, the largest landowner in Florida and one of the richest men in New York. Just after 2 o&#x2019;clock, the yacht slid away from the city&#x2019;s edge and began to glide north up the river. It was bound for Bear Mountain State Park, forty miles north, where the men would join hundreds of Boy Scouts for a tour of inspection and a big dinner.<br> <br>Scouting was all the rage, with a heavy concentration of members in New York and its suburbs. Among these boys, the summer outing to Bear Mountain was the focus of the entire year. Throughout the fall and winter, Scouts attended weekly meetings to learn skills to apply on the annual campout&#x2014;fire making, forestry, astronomy, mapping, compass reading, signaling, outdoor cooking. The whole point of the Scouting year was to prepare for this trip. The boys earned the right to go.<br> <br>Roosevelt heartily approved of the Scouts. His oldest son was a Scout already, and he wanted his three younger boys to join when they could. He believed city boys should hike forest trails and learn to build a fire without matches. He himself had grown up tramping the woods and wetlands of his family&#x2019;s home up the Hudson, shooting and stuffing birds. That, to his mind, was a proper boyhood. A city-bred Boy Scout may be &#x201c;a product of the streets and of artificial conditions of living,&#x201d; he wrote, yet he &#x201c;discovers that the woods, the birds, the fields, the streams, the insects speak a language he understands.&#x201d;<br> <br>But he was taking today&#x2019;s trip to Bear Mountain not just for the sake of the Scouts, nor just to escape the sweltering city. It was the sort of event he attended these days as often as he could, for political purposes.<br> <br>From 1913 to 1920&#x2014;exhausting years of rearming, war, and demobilization&#x2014;he had been assistant secretary of the U.S. Navy under President Woodrow Wilson. Then, just a year before, in July 1920, the Democratic Party had nominated him to run for vice president. (At thirty-eight, he had been two years younger than Theodore Roosevelt, his uncle by marriage and distant cousin by blood, when the latter had been nominated for vice president in 1900.) Roosevelt and his presidential running mate, Governor James M. Cox of Ohio, had been beaten badly by Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. But Roosevelt had sealed his status as a rising star, and now he was cultivating the associations he would need for a statewide race in New York.<br> <br>He might run as early as the following year, in 1922, when he would be just forty years old. He might make a bid for the U.S. Senate seat occupied by William Calder, the Republican real estate developer who had built much of Brooklyn but made no discernible mark in Washington. Or he might challenge Nathan Miller, the Republican governor who had barely nudged the popular Al Smith out of Albany in the Harding-Coolidge landslide of 1920. Al Smith was Roosevelt&#x2019;s ally and friend&#x2014;of a sort; if he decided to run for governor again, Roosevelt would defer to him. If not, Roosevelt would make a highly plausible Democratic candidate for governor of the Empire State&#x2014;and thereby become, quite automatically, a potential candidate for president.<br> <br>There was no need to decide any of that now, in the summer of 1921. For the moment, after eight years entrenched in Washington, Roosevelt was simply reestablishing himself as a New Yorker&#x2014;thus the chairmanship of the local Boy Scout council and a list of other good works for worthy local organizations. Each endeavor meant more opportunities to make new friendships and bolster old ones. On this day trip to Bear Mountain, for instance, every handshake, every quiet chat, every photograph for the newspapers might do a little good toward the greater goal. He was only thirty-nine years old. He possessed one of the great names in American politics. He planned to do a great deal.<br> <br>Aboard Pocantico he was a tall figure telling stories and shouting with laughter (&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;). As a student at the exclusive Groton School and Harvard, he had not excelled in sports, but he certainly looked like an athlete. He stood an inch or so above six feet but somehow seemed larger, perhaps because of his especially large head and jutting chin and his habit of quick and incessant movement. In Washington he had hurled himself into weekend matches in golf, tennis, baseball, and field hockey. During the world war he had plunged into exercises and cross-country runs organized for government men by the great Yale football coach Walter Camp, who called Roosevelt &#x201c;a beautifully built man with the leg muscles of an athlete.&#x201d; At his family&#x2019;s summer home on the island of Campobello, New Brunswick, he loved to lead his five children through a risky chase game called Hare and Hounds, which involved racing up and down rocky escarpments. Instead of walking he often jogged or ran. An associate during the war remembered him flying down the steps of the Naval Observatory, &#x201c;two, three, or four at a time, bobbing up and down like a man jumping rope.&#x201d; At his home in upstate New York he chopped trees, sailed iceboats, sledded with his children, and charged back up the slopes at full tilt.<br> <br>Yet for all his vigor, something made him not quite the quintessential &#x201c;man&#x2019;s man.&#x201d; In his twenties he had been rather staggeringly handsome. At the time of his engagement in 1904, his nineteen-year-old fianc�e had blurted to a friend: &#x201c;I can never hold him; he is too attractive!&#x201d; But he had been handsome in a slightly prissy way. A reporter who compared his looks to those of his world-famous cousin, then the president of the United States, said that while nature had left Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s blocky head &#x201c;unfinished,&#x201d; it had lavished perhaps a little too much loving attention on Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s face. One of Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s nieces, Corinne Robinson Alsop, later likened Franklin&#x2019;s youthful looks to the beau ideal of the Victorian commercial artist. &#x201c;There used to be satin handkerchief boxes,&#x201d; she remarked once, &#x201c;and on top of them there were painted figures with a gentleman dancing a minuet with a handkerchief in his hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In our family we called a certain type &#x2018;handkerchief box-y&#x2019;,&#x201d; and that was Franklin in his early twenties. &#x201c;Franklin wasn&#x2019;t effeminate,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but he wasn&#x2019;t rugged.&#x201d; Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s daughters liked to point out that their sturdy brothers, as young men, had rowed, while Franklin had sailed; they thought that was a revealing difference. They had always said, with titters, that their distant cousin&#x2019;s initials might have stood for &#x201c;Feather Duster.&#x201d; And if Corinne Robinson Alsop insisted FDR was &#x201c;not effeminate,&#x201d; her acid-tongued aunt, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, had referred to him as &#x201c;Miss Nancy&#x201d;&#x2014;slang in society circles for &#x201c;homosexual.&#x201d; That was pure calumny; Roosevelt&#x2019;s preference for women was obvious throughout his life. Yet others too saw some thread in his fabric that struck them as vaguely feminine. The journalist Marquis Childs would later say he had &#x201c;a kind of feminine intuition&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the quality of the actor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who could be photographed and who could speak always with just the right camera angle.&#x201d; An associate of later years remarked that he was &#x201c;the most androgynous man I ever knew.&#x201d; No man acted more hale and hearty, but he used language that a conventional &#x201c;man&#x2019;s man&#x201d; might hesitate to use&#x2014;when he was ill, for instance, he might say he felt &#x201c;weak as a kitten.&#x201d; He seemed a little more at ease with women than he did with men. His father had been twenty-five years older than his mother, who had the more powerful personality of the two parents. Indeed, Roosevelt had been dogged since youth, even among relatives and good friends, by the assumption that he was a &#x201c;mama&#x2019;s boy.&#x201d; In fact, though his mother tried to make his decisions and determine his course, he had been defying her and setting his own course since his teenage years.<br> <br>By now, nearing the age of forty, the slim dandy of the handkerchief box had grown thicker and ruddier. He no longer took care to dress snappily, but, as a woman friend said, &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t make him unattractive, whatever you did.&#x201d;<br> <br>His smile and his habits of speech made the deepest impressions. His smile was massive and winning, with none of the lock-jawed frigidity of upper-crust stereotype. It was an expression that &#x201c;quiver[ed] with animation,&#x201d; shifting from delight to surprise to warmth in the space of seconds. His tenor voice and superb enunciation identified him instantly as a man of American society&#x2019;s highest echelon, though in his refined accent some also heard a hint of the remote coastal villages of Maine where, as a privileged boy fascinated by the sea, he had made friends among fishing-boat captains.<br> <br>When introduced, he seemed merely to fit &#x201c;all the categories of the Good Fellow,&#x201d; as a writer would put it later. &#x201c;He was a backslapper, a mixer,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all the rest of it&#x2014;the kind of undergraduate who would, and did, make a fine permanent chairman of his class committee.&#x201d; But his charm far exceeded ordinary good fellowship. He seemed perfectly delighted to be who he was and equally delighted to bring everyone else in on the sheer fun of being Franklin D. Roosevelt. You knew immediately you were dealing not with an ordinary person but with a personage&#x2014;a presence larger than others and more alive, as if surrounded by a sparkling aura. He regarded himself as someone who ought to be recognized and reckoned with. Even as a young boy he had signed letters to his parents with his initials: &#x201c;FDR.&#x201d;<br> <br>In his early adulthood, that quality had struck many people as sheer arrogance. As a rookie state senator, barely out of his twenties, he affected an air of such upright gentility that he reminded veteran pols of a snooty young Episcopalian clergyman. If they asked him to compromise, he would toss up his chin and say: &#x201c;No! No! I won&#x2019;t hear of it!&#x201d;<br> <br>But ten years in politics had sanded off the haughty shell. The personality he displayed now was all but irresistible. The word &#x201c;charm&#x201d; invariably came up in conversations about him. But it was a strange admixture of forces. There was supreme self-confidence, as if no one could possibly doubt his sincerity, goodwill, and ability.

A good portion of her book is devoted to whetting the appetite--specifically, by her in-depth research on the physical and nutritional properties of the species <i>sativa</i>, its agricultural impact, the cultural myths surrounding rice, and a worldview of this grain's importance. Then she moves on to the recipes, more than 200 of them, all gathered and tested with an eye not to trendiness but to traditional tastes in any country. She's very precise in helping cooks to prepare to tackle her instructions; she gives generic directions--including quantity, texture, and washing and cooking techniques--before presenting each recipe, each one of which is then followed by descriptive lists of ingredients and other culinary methods such as dicing and blanching. Both familiar and exotic dishes, most of them easy to cook, are included: among them, Greek dolmas, chicken and hot sausage gumbo, pork vindaloo, Korean bibimbab, pumpkin risotto, and black rice sorbet. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>The Norton Book of Light Verse</h2><p><p><strong>A collection of entertaining limericks, ballads, lyrics, double dactyls, and more conventional poems by such masters as Ogden Nash, Phyllis McGinley, Anthony Hecht, E.B.

The Norton Book of Light Verse differs from similar endeavors in two other significant ways. Baker includes a large number of Americans (from light verse notables like John Updike, Ogden Nash, and Dorothy Parker to "serious" contemporary poets like Galway Kinnell and Jon Anderson). Further, Baker has arranged his selections into thematic sections ("Life's Losers"; "Bile"; "Beastly Things"; "Departures"; etc.). In his instructive introduction, he points out some of the macabre sources of much light verse, including infanticide and suicide; but this anthology is proof that all aspects of human endeavor are fertile ground of laughter.

The first of three books to deal with this fascinating subject, Basic Vehicle Modelling introduces the modeller to some basic model types with a series of close up, step by step photographs. Working with kits from Tamiya, Verlinden, Revell and others, the less experienced modeller is shown the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of modelling techniques, with particular emphasis on the common difficulties that the inexperienced modeller might face. This series will build into a library of practical information for the modeller.</p><p>A perfect combination of easy-to-follow text combined with comprehensive step-by-step photography make Osprey Modelling Manuals indispensable reference guides for modellers of all standards and abilities.</p><h2>Great Hunters: Their trophy rooms and collections (Volume 1)</h2><p>The greatest hunters from around the world had their rooms professionally photographed for this book, the finest of its kind ever offered.</p><p>This is the most incredible and well-researched book ever produced on trophy hunters and their collections. World-famous hunters from this century share some of the most dazzling rooms ever photographed. Included are Barnhart&#39;s &#34;whitetail wall,&#34; Golabchi&#39;s &#34;sheep mountain,&#34; and life-size mounts of rhino, giraffe, and elephant-there&#39;s even a great white shark! Since trophy rooms have curiously short lives (the collections are usually sold, donated, or accidentally destroyed when the owner dies), these beautifully detailed photographs and highly original text are not just rich in aesthetic value, but are also an important historical record of the world&#39;s greatest trophy rooms, many of which will no longer exist twenty years from now. A must-have for any hunter&#39;s collection.</p><h2>Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, Vol. 4</h2><p>Originally published: 4th rev. ed., Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, c1996.</p><p></p><h2>Eyeball to Eyeball: The Inside Story of the Cuban Missile Crisis</h2><p>Offers a day-to-day account of the crisis, drawing on interviews and inside knowledge to discuss how the Russian missiles were actually discovered, what the United States told foreign leaders, and more</p><p>An insider's tellingly detailed and chilling recap of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Drawing on his firsthand experience as a senior staff member at the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center, interviews with surviving principals, and archival sources, Brugioni offers a comprehensive overview of the confrontation that very nearly plunged the world into nuclear war. But before getting down to business on the critical two-week period that climaxed on October 28 with Moscow's agreement to withdraw offensive weapons systems, he provides valuable background on the development of America's aerial reconnaissance capabilities during the Eisenhower Administration and JFK's ongoing problems with the Castro regime. His stage set, Brugioni settles into a wide-ranging, day-by-day narrative that sheds new light on virtually every aspect of the emergency. Cases in point run from when Soviet missiles of varying ranges were actually detected on the Caribbean island through how the White House kept allies informed, why the US military was put on full alert, the extent to which naval forces blockaded (or ``quarantined,'' in the language of diplomacy) Cuban waters, the crucial go-between role played by ABC-TV's John Scali in Khrushchev's capitulation, where the USSR secreted its warheads, and the reasons Washington did not press for on-site verification by UN representatives once the worse dangers were over. Nor does Brugioni neglect the human side of the potentially deadly encounter. He conveys, for example, the disdain of elder statesman Dean Acheson for the unstructured chaos of the ad hoc advisory meetings convened, without agendas, by one or both of the Kennedy brothers. Without overdramatic comment, the author also recalls phoning his wife to ask her to head for Missouri with their children should the nation's capital be attacked on Saturday the 27th. A definite briefing on one of modern history's landmark events. (Sixteen pages of photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Brugioni, an analyst for many years at the Central Intelligence Agency, uses his specialty in aerial photography, and his governmental contacts, to provide an insider's account of the Cuban missile crisis. His work, based on extensive interviews with participants, many of whom were lesser actors, revises and adds new insights into the motivations which led to President Kennedy's most important decision to put the United States on full military alert. Although focusing on the broader decision itself, Brugioni interweaves the importance of photo reconnaissance and military strategy in foreign policy decision-making, providing an interesting history of this little-known arm of the intelligence community, and a fresh appraisal of actions leading to the decision.

In her new book, FURIOUSLY HAPPY, Jenny explores her lifelong battle with mental illness. A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a terrible idea. And terrible ideas are what Jenny does best. According to Jenny: &#34;Some people might think that being &#39;furiously happy&#39; is just an excuse to be stupid and irresponsible and invite a herd of kangaroos over to your house without telling your husband first because you suspect he would say no since he&#39;s never particularly liked kangaroos. And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their house. Two is the limit. I speak from personal experience. My husband says that none is the new limit. I say he should have been clearer about that before I rented all those kangaroos.&#34; &#34;Most of my favorite people are dangerously fucked-up but you&#39;d never guess because we&#39;ve learned to bare it so honestly that it becomes the new normal. Like John Hughes wrote in The Breakfast Club, &#39;We&#39;re all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it.&#39; Except go back and cross out the word &#39;hiding.&#39;&#34; Jenny&#39;s first book, LET&#39;S PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED, was ostensibly about family, but deep down it was about celebrating your own weirdness. FURIOUSLY HAPPY is a book about mental illness, but under the surface it&#39;s about embracing joy in fantastic and outrageous ways-and who doesn&#39;t need a bit more of that?</p><p></p><h2>Plunder of the Commons: A Manifesto for Sharing Public Wealth (Pelican Books)</h2><p><p>We are losing the commons. Austerity and neoliberal policies have depleted our shared wealth; our national utilities have been sold off to foreign conglomerates, social housing is almost non-existent, our parks are cordoned off for private events and our national&nbsp;art galleries are sponsored by banks and oil companies. This plunder deprives us all of our common rights, recognized as far back as the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest of 1217, to share fairly and equitably in our public wealth. Guy Standing leads us through a new appraisal of the commons, stemming from the medieval concept of common land reserved in ancient law from marauding barons, to his modern reappraisal of the resources we all hold in common - a brilliant new synthesis that crystallises quite how much public wealth has been redirected to the 1% in recent decades through the state-approved exploitation of everything from our land to our state housing, health and benefit systems, to our justice system, schools, newspapers and even the air we breathe. <i>Plunder of the Commons </i>proposes a charter for a new form of commoning, of remembering, guarding and sharing that which belongs to us all, to slash inequality and soothe our current political instability.</p></p><p><b>Guy Standing</b> has held professorships at the University of Bath and at SOAS, was program director at the International Labour Organisation and has advised the UN, World Bank and governments around the world on labor and social policy. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen</i>.<p><b>'One of the most important books I've read in years.' Brian Eno</b></p><br><br>Guy Standing brings great historical knowledge, political insight, and passion to documenting the market enclosures of our common wealth: the great unacknowledged scourge of our time. <i>Plunder of the Commons </i>is both a troubling expos� and a practical-minded call to reclaim the commons for ourselves and posterity. Sitting politicians will ignore this stirring book at their peril. Incoming reformers will learn how we might transform our predatory system of economics and the complicit political culture. - David Bollier, Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the Schumacher Center for a New Economics and author of Free, Fair and Alive: The Insurgent Power of the Commons -<br><br><p>In an era of intensifying privatisation, we're rapidly losing sight of the idea that there are things that can be shared communally without being owned by anybody, things that stand outside of the market system - for example rivers, forests, and other natural resources. Many of them have already been sold off to private interests, and most of the rest are being pursued. This incendiary book exposes this process and explores its corrosive effect on society and resource maintenance. </p><p>This clear and radical exposition is a call for the defence of the commons, and one of the most important books I've read in years.</p> - Brian Eno -</p><h2>A Victorian Portrait: Victorian Life and Values As Seen Through the Work of Studio Photographers</h2><p>Gathers Victorian photographs and explains what they reveal about the period&#39;s attitudes</p><p>From Miles's collection of 10,000 previously unpublished images, the authors have chosen 200 exemplars of Victorian life that "require historical cross examination." Such themes as pride, love, the Empire, work, and leisure are thus examined through images of ordinary people taken by photographers from every corner of Britain. The range of photographs reinforces the text's contention that the widespread dissemination of photography and the exchange of images was a vital feature of Victorian life.

They traveled alone or with their families by railroad, wagon train, and even on foot. Miller brings these pioneers' stories to life through quotations from diaries, letters, and vintage travel guides. Equally dramatic are the sepia-toned photographs that appear on nearly every page, the most delightful of which is a picture of two daredevils in long skirts cavorting on a rock formation in Yosemite Valley. While this title covers much of the same information as Judith Alter's Women of the Old West (Watts, 1989), it is livelier and gives more equitable coverage of African American pioneers, Native Americans, and Mexican Americans. Buffalo Gals will appeal to fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, and to any student with a hankering for a good read. Yeeeee-ha!?Rebecca O'Connell, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-7. Miller's remarkable book acquaints children with a historically accurate picture of the daily life of nineteenth-century women of the western frontier. Forget Hollywood, and forget the Little House books. Without neglecting the story of the Native American women who lived on the frontier, Miller catches both the bone-wearying labor and the excitement that sometimes made living in the West worthwhile. She deftly augments her text with excerpts from journals and memoirs as well as photographs from regional archives, which are especially effective because the images are not familiar ones. Captions on the photos could have been more complete (they sometimes lack date or location), but the overall effect of the book is memorable. <i>Mary Harris Veeder</i></p><h2>A Question of Intelligence: The IQ Debate in America</h2><p>A look at the inequality in human intelligence addresses the sensitive issue of ethnic and national differences in IQ, outlining correlations between IQ levels and economic achievements, arguing for the continuation of the IQ tests many consider biased. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Fortune magazine columnist Seligman here targets the prevailing wisdom that IQ tests are culturally biased, that environment is more significant than genetics. His provocative argument, based on academic literature and interviews with scholars, is convincing: IQ tests do indeed measure mental abilities, those abilities are in substantial measure heritable and testing is worthwhile for it generates data of enormous social value and explanatory power. Seligman debunks media coverage of Chicago teacher Marva Collins and others who claim to dramatically raise the IQs of disadvantaged children in the classroom. But the book rambles. He devotes too much space to the history of IQ testing and the background of psychologist Arthur Jensen and his controversial theory that intelligence is determined largely by genes, rather than fully exploring, for example, why Asians and Jews score higher on IQ tests. Seligman maintains that environmental effects explain only part of the gap in IQ test scores between American blacks and whites and stresses that many scholars believe that the differences are attributable to genetics. The book concludes with an attack on affirmative action and a proposal that people should be treated as individuals. Seligman is to be credited with raising issues in a debate that many shy away from as too heated. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Seligman, a former senior staff editor of Time Inc. Publications and a columnist for Fortune , utilizes professional opinion studies, and statistical concepts to endorse intelligence quotients. He discusses "practical intelligence" and academic performance, explains the nature-nurture hypothesis (heritability vs. environment), and explores the latter's significance in twin studies, black-white tests, and Jewish-Japanese comparisons. For more objectivity, Raymond E. Fancher's The Intelligence Men: Makers of the IQ Controversy ( LJ 6/15/85) encompasses the scientific inquiry from the contributors and creators of IQ and is loaded with direct quotes. This 85-year-old dispute, Seligman says, has developed because Americans want to believe in equality, but IQ only verifies difference. His scholarly yet readable update to the argument is recommended for large education collections. (Bibliography, notes, and index not seen.)-- Ina M. Wise, Daley Community Coll.

This Ruth Krauss classic enchanted young readers when it was first published in 1947. Now it blooms again with lush illustrations by one of the world's best-loved illustrators: Helen Oxenbury.</p></p><p><p><strong>Ruth Krauss</strong> was one of the most widely celebrated children&#x2019;s book authors of all time. Her long list of award-winning books includes <em>The Carrot Seed</em>, <em>The Happy Day</em>, <em>A Hole Is to Dig</em>, <em>Open House for Butterflies</em>, <em>A Very Special House</em>, and many others. Her books continue to be read and cherished by children throughout the world.</p>*Starred Review* In the original, 1947 edition of Krauss' classic story, Phyllis Rowand's illustrations featured a small boy, dressed in checked pants, a red jacket, and a jaunty cap, who wonders if he is getting bigger. Now, Oxenbury lightens and brightens the palette and sets the boy against pages of inviting white space that open the story. In late spring, the boy, his puppy, and some baby chicks are "very little." As the days grow longer and the grass grows faster, the boy informs the animals, "We're growing too." Together he and his mother put away his winter clothes, forgotten as spring stretches into summer and summer shortens into fall. The boy asks more than once if he is growing, even as he can see his puppy is now a dog, the chicks have now become chickens. Winter approaches, and it's time to take down the warm clothes. To the child's delight, his pants are too tight, his sleeves are too short. Finally, he has visible proof. "I'm growing too," he shouts as he does handstands across the final spread. The story gets right to a child's experiences as it expresses both wondering and wonderment. This comes out beautifully in art that captures the affection between a boy and his hardworking mother who makes a bountiful place of the land they farm.

Asking how interests are defined and how changes in them are accommodated, Martha Finnemore shows the fruitfulness of a constructivist approach to international politics. She draws on insights from sociological institutionalism to develop a systemic approach to state interests and state behavior by investigating an international structure not of power but of meaning and social value. An understanding of what states want, she argues, requires insight into the international social structure of which they are a part. States are embedded in dense networks of transnational and international social relations that shape their perceptions and their preferences in consistent ways. Finnemore focuses on international organizations as one important component of social structure and investigates the ways in which they redefine state preferences. She details three examples in different issue areas. In state structure, she discusses UNESCO and the changing international organization of science. In security, she analyzes the role of the Red Cross and the acceptance of the Geneva Convention rules of war. Finally, she focuses on the World Bank and explores the changing definitions of development in the Third World. Each case shows how international organizations socialize states to accept new political goals and new social values in ways that have lasting impact on the conduct of war, the workings of the international political economy, and the structure of states themselves.</p></p><p>Martha Finnemore is Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University.

But Christmas this year promises to be one no one will <em>ever</em> forget. You know that handsome celebrity chef everyone's been talking about, Shane Roarke? Don't tell anyone, but it turns out he has a remarkable&#x2014;and shocking!&#x2014;connection to our town. And not everyone is going to be happy about it....<br><br>Gianna Garrison has been looking downright radiant, however. Is it true that the Gallatin Room waitress has been sneaking under the mistletoe with the mysterious maverick? Hang on to your spurs, merry readers, because the surprises are just beginning. Wait till Gianna finds out who her sexy boss <em>really</em> is!<br><br></p><p>Teresa Southwick&nbsp;lives with her husband in Las Vegas, the city that reinvents itself every day. An avid fan of romance novels, she is delighted to be living out her dream of writing for Harlequin.When he'd come to Thunder Canyon five months ago looking for his biological parents, Shane Roarke never expected to find out that his father was in jail for stealing from the town. So far his mother's identity was still a mystery, but maybe that was for the best. Did he really want to meet the woman who'd shown the bad judgment to hook up with a criminal? And what did that say about his own DNA?<p>He'd arrived a city-slicker chef with a list of questions about who he was. Now he had half the answers and a lot to lose if anyone else found out. The information and what to do about it weighed heavy on his mind.</p><p>In June he'd taken the executive chef position at The Gallatin Room, the fine-dining restaurant at Thunder Canyon Resort. With successful restaurants in L.A., New York and Seattle it had been a career step-down, but necessary for personal reasons. Now he was the definition of a man in conflict&#x2014;part of him wished he'd never come, while the other part really liked this town. "Oh, you're still here&#x2014;"</p><p>Shane looked up from the glass of wine in front of him to the redhead who'd just walked into his kitchen. Gianna Garrison was a waitress and part-time bartender on his staff. In the big cities where he'd worked his name had been linked to models, actresses and celebrities, but he'd never seen a more beautiful woman than the one in front of him now, looking like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>"I'm still here," he agreed.</p><p>"Like the captain of a ship."</p><p>"The last to leave." He smiled.</p><p>Gianna was wearing the black slacks and long-sleeved white shirt all the waitresses wore but it looked better on her. The tucked-in blouse accentuated breasts, not too big or too small, which only left just right. Her waist was trim, her legs slim and that curly, shoulder-length red hair always got his attention even from across a crowded room. Close-up was even better.</p><p>"Sorry to bother you." She started to back out of the room. "I'll just be going."</p><p>She wasn't bothering him. In fact she'd done him a favor. Shane realized the last thing he wanted was to be alone with his dark thoughts.</p><p>"Wait. We were a waitress short tonight." Pretty lame stating the obvious, but he'd just switched mental gears and it was the best he could come up with to stop her from leaving.</p><p>"Yeah, Bonnie has a bad cold. Coughing, sneezing and breathing germs on that party of ski executives from Switzerland seemed counterproductive to the goal."</p><p>Shane nodded. "Convincing them that Thunder Canyon has the snow, slopes and service to make it a winter vacation destination for Europeans."</p><p>"Right. And have you seen any of those movies on the flu pandemic and how disease spreads? We wouldn't want Thunder Canyon identified as ground zero by the Centers for Disease Control. The Swiss would probably hear about it."</p><p>"That wouldn't be good. Bonnie was wise to call herself off."</p><p>The humor sparkling in her eyes made them almost turquoise. He hadn't noticed that before, which wasn't surprising. Between work, looking for his birth parents and feeling guilty about it on account of his real parents who loved him unconditionally, he'd been a little preoccupied. Now she was only a couple of feet away and he noticed that her eyes were wide and beautiful, like the Caribbean Ocean. If he wasn't careful, he could drown in them.</p><p>"So one waitress less means you worked twice as hard," he said.</p><p>She lifted one shoulder in a no-big-deal gesture. "I just moved faster, smiled more and dazzled them with the Garrison wit, hoping they had no idea it was taking just a little longer to get their orders delivered. The complimentary bottle of wine you sent over to the table didn't hurt, either. By the way, they raved about the food and seemed surprised. You'd think the invention of Swiss cheese entitled them to culinary domination of the universe."</p><p>"I'm guessing you didn't say that to them."</p><p>"No." She grinned.</p><p>"The head of the delegation complimented me on the food and service before they left. He promised me maximum stars, diamonds, happy faces, thumbs-up, however they designate their rating. Without you I couldn't have pulled that off, Gianna."</p><p>Her wit wasn't the only thing about her that dazzled. When she smiled, her face lit up like the town square decorated for Christmas. "I'm flattered you noticed."</p><p>"I make it my business to notice. It crossed my mind to come out to help serve, but I couldn't get away."</p><p>"Cooking is what you do. Delivering what you cook is my job."</p><p>"There's more to it than that. Even when the food is good it's not always easy to keep the customer happy. But you make it look easy. Tonight you did a fantastic job."</p><p>"I just handled it," she said modestly.</p><p>"You always do. You're one of my best waitresses. Thanks for all your hard work. I appreciate it very much."</p><p>"No problem. It's what you pay me for but it's nice to hear you say it." Gianna backed up a little more. "I'll just be going now."</p><p>No, he thought. Her dazzle kept the dark away and he wasn't ready for it to come back yet. He wanted her to stay. Saying that straight out might make her nervous, think he was hitting on her. That wasn't his intention. The pleasure of her company was his only goal; the question was how to achieve it.</p><p>All Shane could come up with was a delaying tactic. "Did you want something?"</p><p>"Why do you ask?"</p><p>"You came in the kitchen."</p><p>"Oh, that. It's just, you know&#x2014;" Her shrug did interesting things to her breasts. "Tonight's special looked and smelled amazing so..."</p><p>"You're hungry." Of course. What other reason would she have for coming here when her shift was over. After a mental forehead slap, he said, "Doing the work of two people didn't leave time for a dinner break."</p><p>"It's my own fault. I missed the staff meal before service started. I'll just grab something on the way home."</p><p>"No." He stood and walked over to her. "The least I can do is feed you. And there will be a glass of wine involved."</p><p>"Don't make a mess on my account. The dishwasher and prep crew already cleaned up."</p><p>"But I'm the boss. I have a nice Pino Grigio already uncorked and it pairs well with the spinach and crab ravioli." He led her to the stool he'd just vacated then pressed gently on her shoulders, urging her to sit. The slight touch ignited a need in his belly and the instinct to pull her against him was unexpectedly powerful.</p><p>It was his business to notice workflow in the restaurant and he had. Just because it wasn't his job to be attracted to someone working the flow didn't make the attraction any less real. But he still wasn't hitting on her. This was just a gesture. A happy staff didn't quit and contented workers kept things running smoothly. Training a new waitress was time consuming and costly.</p><p>"I was going to have something myself. Please join me."</p><p>"Okay, then. Thanks." She rested her heel on the metal rung of the stool and crossed one leg over the other.</p><p>The movement was graceful, sexy, and it was an effort to pull his gaze away. On his first day at The Gallatin Room, Gianna Garrison had caught his eye, but for professional and personal reasons he'd resisted the impulse to act on the temptation. Until tonight.</p><p>Just before Thanksgiving he'd received conclusive proof that Arthur Swinton, the most hated man in Thunder Canyon, was his biological father. The information had weighed on him over the last couple of days and he was low on willpower. That was the best explanation he could come up with for this lapse in professional judgment. It was time to do his chef thing and take his mind off other things.</p><p>While he worked assembling plates, warming food, pouring wine, Gianna chattered away. He let her, liking the sound of her voice, the warm honey with just a hint of gravel. Then something she said tapped into his dark mood again.</p><p>"The Thanksgiving dinner you prepared last week for military families was amazing. Everyone in town is talking about it. Angie Anderson and Forrest Traub told me how thrilled the families were, how special and appreciated they felt for their loved ones' sacrifices."</p><p>He'd been more preoccupied than usual since that night. People had looked at him like he walked on water and he felt like a fraud. How could he be a walk on water type when Arthur Swinton was his biological father? The man had been convicted and sent to jail for embezzling public funds. Not only that, he'd perpetrated a conspiracy to ruin the Traubs, one of the most prominent families in town. If there was someone who didn't hate Swinton, Shane hadn't met them yet.</p><p>Gianna smiled at him. "They said it really helped because of missing their loved ones overseas so much, especially around the holidays."</p><p>"I know something about missing family," Shane whispered.</p><p>"What's that?" she asked.</p><p>He slid hot food onto two plates, then looked over his shoulder. "You're missing something if you don't eat this while it's hot."</p><p>"It looks wonderful and smells even better."</p><p>He put the two steaming plates on the stainless-steel countertop, then pulled up another stool and sat at a right angle to her. "Dig in."</p><p>"Okay." After she did, her gaze met his. "This is sinfully good. I don't even want to think about the calories."</p><p>"It's a little-known fact that when you do the work of two people calories don't count."</p><p>"Thank goodness. Because this tastes even better than it smells and it smells very fattening." She licked a drop of white wine sauce from her lower lip.</p><p>For a second, Shane thought he was going to choke on his own food. The look on her face was th...</p></p><h2>Astream: American Writers on Fly Fishing</h2><p>This marvelous collection features stories from some of America&#x2019;s finest and most respected writers about one of the world&#x2019;s most solitary and satisfying sports: fly fishing.

He established his own homestead on a forested tract beside an impetuous mountain torrent, where he has lived for nearly three decades. The author deals chiefly with the Valley of El General, in the rainy southern Pacific portion of Costa Rica, where he has watched the conversion of a magnificent wilderness into a multitude of farms. he tells of the year he spent in the mountain forests following the complete nesting cycle of the Quetzal, the most splendid bird in the Western hemisphere. he writes of journeys over rough mountain trails, of life in the backwoods, of primitive agriculture on rough tropical lands, and of curious types of floral and animal behavior. A chapter is devoted to the hardy pioneers among whom the author lived during his early years in El General.

Their mama has gone away many times before, but something tells them that this time she won&#39;t be coming back. Then a social worker comes and takes them to meet their Aunt Gracie. Beebee barely remembers her, and Mama never even told Johnson about her. They wonder where she&#39;s been all this time--and why she would want to take care of them. Warily, though, the children begin to trust Aunt Gracie. And in the process, they come to a better understanding of what it means to be a family.</p><p><br> <strong>Jacqueline Woodson</strong>is the winner of the 2006 Margaret A. Edwards Award for Lifetime Achievement. She is the author of many critically acclaimed books for children, and has received numerous awards, including a Newbery Honor Award for <i>Show Way</i>, a Coretta Scott King Award, and five Coretta Scott King Author Honors.

He is also the writer and illustrator of <i>The Three Questions</i>, which the <i>New York Times</i>called "quietly life changing." Jon J Muth lives with his family in Kingston, New York.Woodson's (Miracle's Boys) affecting story introduces a boy and girl seemingly abandoned by their mother. "Sometimes my mama went away for a day. Sometimes for a lot of days. That's how it was with our mama," says Johnson. A kind woman appears at the door, explaining that her job "is to make sure little kids get taken care of"; it sounds good to Johnson, but his more cynical older sister, Beebee, warns him the woman means foster care: "It's when you live with somebody that's not your mama." Eventually, the woman drives the siblings to their mother's sister, who is estranged from their mother. Aunt Gracie is as warm and welcoming as her clapboard house with its sprawling porch, flowerbeds and tire swing. Johnson is enchanted by the idyllic setting and by his aunt, who bakes cookies and tucks him in at bedtime, and even Beebee slowly warms up to her. After a visit to their apparently hospitalized mother, who assures them that Gracie will care for them until she is able to, the two return to Gracie's open arms. Muth's (Gershon's Monster) spare paintings, often set as vignettes against a white background, effectively convey the children's sense of isolation and, later, belonging. Muth evokes the characters' emotions and supplies information that Woodson wisely omits from Johnson's narration (the emptiness of the apartment, with the children's spilled glasses and broken toy; the hospital setting). Because of Woodson and Muth's restraint, the rosy qualities of this tale do not impair its emotional truth.

Maynard Solomon&#x2019;s <i>Late Beethoven</i> investigates the phenomenon of the final phase, focusing especially on the striking metamorphosis in Beethoven&#x2019;s system of beliefs that began early in his fifth decade and eventually amounted to a sweeping realignment of his views of nature, antiquity, divinity, and human purpose.<br><br>Using the composer&#x2019;s letters, diaries, and conversation books, Solomon traces Beethoven&#x2019;s attraction to a constellation of heterogeneous ideas, drawn from Romanticism, Freemasonry, comparative religion, Eastern initiatory ritual, Mediterranean mythology, aesthetics, and classical and contemporary thought. Through these often arcane sources, Beethoven gained access to a vast reservoir of imagery and ideas with the potential to expand music&#x2019;s expressive and communicative reach. This "multitude of productive images," writes Solomon, "provided kindling for the blaze of his imagination."<br><br><i>Late Beethoven</i> is a rich tapestry of original perspectives on Beethoven&#x2019;s music. Solomon sees the Seventh Symphony as a deployment of the rhythms of antiquity in an effort to revalidate the premises of the Classical world; the Ninth as an essay on the prospects and limits of affirmative, monumental endings; and the "Diabelli" Variations as a doorway to the universe of metaphoric significances that attach to beginnings. In the Violin Sonata in G, op. 96, Solomon finds a restoration of the full range of pastoral experience that the ancient poets had known. In the Grosse Fuge he locates issues of fragmentation and reassembly, and he suggests that pivotal passages of the last sonatas evoke sacred states of being.<br><br>These stimulating perspectives illuminate the inner world within which Beethoven dwelled during his last fifteen years and the ways in which his thought and music may be interrelated. Written in accessible and eloquent prose, and with numerous music examples, <i>Late Beethoven</i> is a serious contribution to understanding this miraculous quantum leap in Beethoven&#x2019;s creative evolution.</p><p>"Maynard Solomon writes with an unrivaled control of a vast cultural and intellectual sweep that reaches beyond Ancient Greece, and with a graceful precision that disguises the rich complexity of his ideas. Distilling from the late works their sources in both the overarching themes of mankind and the troubled psyche of the composer, he has forever altered a familiar landscape."&#x2014;Richard Kramer, Distinguished Professor, Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and author of <i>Distant Cycles: Schubert and the Conceiving of Song</i><br><br>"With a bow to the immortal study by J.W.N. Sullivan, <i>Late Beethoven</i> could have also been called "Beethoven: His Spiritual Development." Solomon weaves amazingly diverse threads, chapter by chapter, into the fabric of Beethoven's belief system, his take on nature, divinity, human purpose, morality, and the mission of music. This is a book of surprises by an author whose combination of breadth of thought, imaginativeness, aesthetic sensitivity, and learning is really wonderful.&#x2014;Joseph Kerman, author, with Alan Tyson, of <i>The New Grove Beethoven</i><b>Maynard Solomon</b> is on the Graduate Faculty at the Juilliard School.

Edmund Campion (1540-1581) was a Jesuit priest who, in the turbulent years before the Spanish Armada, was charged with treason and executed. Waugh&#39;s book is an elegant homage to a man he revered as a hero and a martyr. Ronald Knox (1888-1957) was regarded as the most distinguished Anglican Clerical convert to Catholicism since Newman. His literary output was huge, ranging from monumental translation of the Vulgate Bible to his much-admired crime novels that bear comparison to the Father Brown stories by G.K. Chesterton.

But where do butterflies come from? How are they born? What do they eat--and how?<br> With a simple, rhyming text and glorious color-drenched collage, Lois Ehlert provides clear answers to these and other questions as she follows the life cycle of four common butterflies, from their beginnings as tiny hidden eggs and hungry caterpillars to their transformation into full-grown butterflies. Complete with butterfly and flower facts and identification tips, as well as a guide to planting a butterfly garden, this butterfly book is like no other.<br></p><p>Lois Ehlert, beloved illustrator of <i>Chicka Chicka Boom Boom</i> and many other bold, beautiful picture books has outdone herself with this gorgeous (seriously breathtaking) celebration of butterfly metamorphosis. "Out in the fields, eggs are hidden from view, / clinging to leaves with butterfly glue. / Soon caterpillars hatch. They creep and chew. / Each one knows what it must do." As the gentle rhyme unfolds, we turn the small, partial pages that form the larger spread of fabulous foliage in this lush, oversized book. Before our eyes, the eggs turn to caterpillars, the caterpillars to cases, the cases to lovely butterflies. "They pump their wings, get ready to fly, then hungry butterflies head for the sky." The colors become increasingly dazzling, each butterfly springing to life with Ehlert's color-soaked cut-paper magic. Several pages of background material conclude the book, labeling different kinds of butterflies at different stages of development, from the buckeye butterfly to the painted lady to the monarch. A "Butterfly Information" page clearly labels butterfly anatomy and answers basic question about these fascinating fluttery insects, a "Flower Identification" page showcases butterfly-attracting flowers such as the purple coneflower (echinacea), phlox, and lantana, and the last page offers a few pointers on growing a butterfly garden.

Hamburger first went to work for The New Yorker in 1939, under the aegis of Harold Ross, and he is&nbsp;&nbsp;still there--six decades and four editors later. He has wandered all over its pages as Our Man Stanley or Reporter at Large, doing Talk of the Town, Casuals, and Notes &amp; Comment, writing Profiles, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he has wandered all over the map, unearthing the secret souls of some fifty-five American towns&nbsp;&nbsp;and cities (from Hot Springs, Arkansas, to Butte, Montana) and bearing witness to the horrors of war&nbsp;&nbsp;and fascism (from Mussolini's bloody corpse hanging upside down in a Milan public square, to the&nbsp;&nbsp;hungry, hollow-eyed marchers bearing pro-Tito posters through the wrecked streets of Belgrade&nbsp;&nbsp;after the war).<br>An old-fashioned liberal--and proud of it-- Hamburger has witnessed almost every inauguration since&nbsp;&nbsp;1933 (at Roosevelt's first he was perched on the icy branch of a tree), has spied shamelessly on a succession of New York City mayors (he used to live conveniently across from Gracie Mansion), and has constantly championed the voices of liberty (Judge Learned Hand, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Judge William Henry Hastie, Edward R. Murrow).<br>Insatiably curious, Hamburger strikes for the heart of whatever subject he approaches--whether it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;famous (Truman, Toscanini, Evita Per�n, Eleanor Roosevelt, Vartan Gregorian) or the unsung hero (a waiter who single-handedly sold four million dollars' worth of war bonds). Hitler's aerie in Berchtesgaden is as fascinating to him as the twisting ramps of Macy's package delivery tunnels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamburger never balked at donning a different hat; he quite literally put on a black homburg as The New Yorker's music critic for a year. He took on movies and was the first to venture into the minefield of television, conjuring up brilliantly the wonders and abominations of what he saw in the 1950s on the flickering black-and-white screen.<br>All these adventures, and many more, are here in this treasure of a book--the work of a New Yorker writer who wrote what he pleased, went where he wanted, and took as much time as he needed. With wit and insight and extraordinary scrupulousness, Philip Hamburger penetrates the darkness and reveals for us the many pleasures he has had talking to these friends in the night.</p><p>Philip Hamburger was born in Wheeling, West&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia, in 1914. At an early age he caught a sleeper to New York City. Except for a wartime stint in Washington,&nbsp;&nbsp;D.C., and overseas assignments, he has lived there ever since.A mainstay of the New Yorker staff since 1939, Hamburger has written everything from Talk of the Town entries to casuals and profiles; he even served as music critic and movie reviewer. Dozens of pieces are collected here, arranged chronologically within each category. The few comments provided by Hamburger are helpful: A ``Stanley'' essay was written, for example, to explore ``small, little-known islands in the East River and New York Harbor,'' and was authored by none other than the self-styled Our Man Stanley. Much of the material is dated; some of Hamburgers observations appear comically off the mark. For instance, in 1950 he became the first New Yorker writer to venture into the ``cultural minefield'' of television. He describes the early Candid Camera TV series as ``sadistic, poisonous, anti-human, and sneaky''; he dismisses Frank Sinatra and his singing on the October 1951 debut of his show as being either ``asleep or else . . . quite ill.'' Hamburger fared a bit better as an amateur'' music critic in the late 1940s, although Toscanini demanded that he be fired. Hamburger wrote many fine profiles over the years, with the best a 1986 piece on Vartan Gregorian. His parodic profile of then-popular J.P. Marquand may be lost on many readers today. A 1944 profile of Louie the Waiter at the Sixth Avenue Delicatessena man noted not only for his service-oriented doggerel, but for selling $4 million worth of war bondsis a prime example of New Yorker writing at its finest. Uneven, but what writer's 60-year output wouldn't be? There's great stuff here, representative of a kind of writing and reportage that, sadly, is passing. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.
